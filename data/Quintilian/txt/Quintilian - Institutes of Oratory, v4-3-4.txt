Above all, our orator should be equipped
with a rich store of examples both old and new
and he ought not merely to know those which are
recorded in history or transmitted by oral tradition
or occur from day to day, but should not neglect even those fictitious examples invented by the great
poets. For while the former have the authority of
evidence or even of legal decisions, the latter also
either have the warrant of antiquity or are regarded
as having been invented by great men to serve as
lessons to the world. He should therefore be acquainted with as many examples as possible. It is
this which gives old age so much authority, since
the old are believed to have a larger store of knowledge and experience, as Homer so frequently bears
witness. But we must not wait till the evening of
our days, since study has this advantage that, as far
as knowledge of facts is concerned, it is capable of
giving the impression that we have lived in ages
long gone by.
