Though I have spoken in some detail of the
duties of the teacher, I shall for the moment confine
my advice to the learners to one solitary admonition,
that they should love their masters not less than
their studies, and should regard them as the parents
not indeed of their bodies but of their minds. Such
attachments are of invaluable assistance to study.
For under their influence they find it a pleasure to
listen to their teachers, believe what they say and
long to be like them, come cheerfully and gladly to
school, are not angry when corrected, rejoice when
praised, and seek to win their master's affection by
the devotion with which they pursue their studies. For as it is the duty of the master to teach, so it is
the duty of the pupil to show himself teachable. The
two obligations are mutually indispensable. And just
as it takes two parents to produce a human being,
and as the seed is scattered in vain, if the ground is
hard and there is no furrow to receive it and bring it
to growth, even so eloquence can never come to maturity, unless teacher and taught are in perfect
sympathy.
