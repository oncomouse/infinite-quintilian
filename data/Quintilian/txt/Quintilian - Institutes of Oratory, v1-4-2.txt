The question as to the origin of rhetoric need
not keep us long. For who can doubt that mankind
received the gift of speech from nature at its birth
for we can hardly go further back than that, while
the usefulness of speech brought improvement and
study, and finally method and exercise gave perfection I cannot understand why some hold that
the elaboration of speech originated in the fact that those who were in peril owing to some accusation
being made against them, set themselves to speak
with studied care for the purpose of their own defence. This, however, though a more honourable origin, cannot possibly be the earlier, for
accusation necessarily precedes defence. You might
as well assert that the sword was invented for the
purpose of self-defence and not for aggression. It
was, then, nature that created speech, and observation that originated the art of speaking. Just as men
discovered the art of medicine by observing that some
things were healthy and some the reverse, so they
observed that some things were useful and some useless in speaking, and noted them for imitation or
avoidance, while they added certain other precepts
according as their nature suggested. These observations were confirmed by experience and each man
proceeded to teach what he knew. Cicero, it is
true, attributes the origin of oratory to the founders
of cities and the makers of laws, who must needs
have possessed the gift of eloquence. But why he
thinks this the actual origin, I cannot understand,
since there still exist certain nomad peoples without
cities or laws, and yet members of these peoples perform the duties of ambassadors, accuse and defend,
and regard one man as a better speaker than
another.
