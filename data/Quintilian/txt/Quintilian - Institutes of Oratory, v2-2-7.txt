With regard to oaths, parties either offer to
take an oath themselves, or refuse to accept the oath
of their opponent, demand that their opponent
should take an oath or refuse to comply with a
similar demand when proffered to themselves. To
offer to take an oath unconditionally without
demanding that one's opponent should likewise take
an oath is as a rule a sign of bad faith. If, however,
anyone should take this course, he will defend his
action by appealing to the blamelessness of his life as rendering perjury on his part incredible, or by the
solemn nature of the oath, with regard to which he
will win all the greater credence, if without the
least show of eagerness to take the oath he makes it
clear that he does not shrink from so solemn a duty.
Or again, if the case is such as to make this possible,
he will rely on the trivial nature of the point in
dispute to win belief, on the ground that he would
not incur the risk of the divine displeasure when so
little is at stake. Or, finally, he may in addition to
the other means which he employs to win his case
offer to take an oath as a culminating proof of a
clear conscience. The man who refuses to accept his
opponent's offer to take an oath, will allege that the
inequality of their respective conditions are not the
same for both parties and will point out that many
persons are not in the least afraid of committing
perjury, even philosophers having been found to deny
that the gods intervene in human affairs; and further
that he who is ready to take an oath without being
asked to do so, is really proposing to pass sentence
on his own case and to show what an easy and trivial
thing he thinks the oath which he offers to take.
On the other hand the man who proposes to put
his opponent on oath appears to act with moderation,
since he is making his adversary a judge in his own
case, while he frees the actual judge from the burden
of coming to a decision, since the latter would
assuredly prefer to rest on another man's oath than
on his own. This fact makes the refusal to take an
oath all the more difficult, unless indeed the affair
in question be of such a nature that it cannot be
supposed that the facts are known to the person
asked to take the oath. Failing this excuse, there is only one course open to him he must say that
his opponent is trying to excite a prejudice against
him and is endeavouring to give the impression that
he has real ground for complaint though he is not in
a position to win his case; consequently, though a
dishonest man would eagerly have availed himself of
the proposal, he prefers to prove the truth of his
statements rather than leave a doubt in anyone's
mind as to whether he has committed perjury or no.
But in my young days advocates grown old in pleading used to lay it down as a rule that we should
never be in a hurry to propose that our opponent
should take an oath, just as we should never allow
him the choice of a judge nor select our judge
from among the supporters of the opposite side for
if it is regarded as a disgrace to such a supporter
to say anything against his client, it is surely a still
worse disgrace that he should do anything that will
harm his client's case.
