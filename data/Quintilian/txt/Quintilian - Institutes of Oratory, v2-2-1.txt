There have been certain writers of no small
authority who have held that the sole duty of the
orator was to instruct in their view appeals to the
emotions were to be excluded for two reasons, first
on the ground that all disturbance of the mind was
a fault, and secondly that it was wrong to distract
the judge from the truth by exciting his pity, bringing influence to bear, and the like. Further, to seek
to charm the audience, when the aim of the orator
was merely to win success, was in their opinion not
only superfluous for a pleader, but hardly worthy of
a self-respecting man. The majority however, while
admitting that such arts undoubtedly formed part of
oratory, held that its special and peculiar task is to
make good the case which it maintains and refute
that of its opponent. Whichever of these views is
correct for at this point I do not propose to express
my own opinion, they will regard this book as
serving a very necessary purpose, since it will deal
entirely with the points on which they lay such
stress, although all that I have already said on the
subject of judicial causes is subservient to the same
end. For the purpose of the exordium and the slatement of facts is merely to prepare the judge for these
points, while it would be a work of supererogation to
know the bases of cases or to consider the other points dealt with above, unless we intend to proceed
to the consideration of the proof Finally, of the
five parts into which we divided judicial cases, any
single one other than the proof may on occasion be
dispensed with. But there can be no suit in which
the proof is not absolutely necessary. With regard
to the rules to be observed in this connexion, we
shall, I think, be wisest to follow our previous method
of classification and show first what is common to all
cases and then proceed to point out those which are
peculiar to the several kinds of cases.
