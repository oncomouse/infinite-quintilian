With regard to rumour and common report,
one party will call them the verdict of public opinion and the testimony of the world at large; the
other will describe them as vague talk based on no
sure authority, to which malignity has given birth

innocent of men may be exposed by the deliberate
dissemination of falsehood on the part of their
enemies. It will be easy for both parties to produce
precedents to support their arguments.
