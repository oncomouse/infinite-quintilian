 You have daily importuned me with the request
that I should at length take steps to publish the
book on the Education of an Orator which I dedicated
to my friend Marcellus. For my own view was that
it was not yet ripe for publication. As you know I
have spent little more than two years on its composition, during which time moreover I have been distracted by a multitude of other affairs. These two
years have been devoted not so much to actual writing
as to the research demanded by a task to which
practically no limits can be set and to the reading
of innumerable authors. Further, following the precept of Horace who in his Art of Poetry deprecates
hasty publication and urges the would-be author I proposed to give them time, in order that the
ardour of creation might cool and that I might
revise them with all the consideration of a dispassionate reader. But if there is such a demand for
their publication as you assert, why then let us
spread our canvas to the gale and offer up a fervent
prayer to heaven as we put out to sea. But remember I rely on your loyal care to see that they
reach the public in as correct a form as possible. div1
