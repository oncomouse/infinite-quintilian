Education of an Orator which I dedicated\nto my friend Marcellus. For my own view was that\nit was not yet ripe for publication. As you know I\nhave spent little more than two years on its composition, during which time moreover I have been distracted by a multitude of other affairs. These two\nyears have been devoted not so much to actual writing\nas to the research demanded by a task to which\npractically no limits can be set and to the reading\nof innumerable authors. Further, following the precept of Horace who in his Art of Poetry deprecates\nhasty publication and urges the would-be author I proposed to give them time, in order that the\nardour of creation might cool and that I might\nrevise them with all the consideration of a dispassionate reader. But if there is such a demand for\ntheir publication as you assert, why then let us\nspread our canvas to the gale and offer up a fervent\nprayer to heaven as we put out to sea. But remember I rely on your loyal care to see that they\nreach the public in as correct a form as possible.  Having at length, after twenty years devoted to\nthe training of the young, obtained leisure for study,\nI was asked by certain of my friends to write\nsomething on the art of speaking. For a long time I\nresisted their entreaties, since I was well aware that\nsome of the most distinguished Greek and Roman\nwriters had bequeathed to posterity a number of\nworks dealing with this subject, to the composition\nof which they had devoted the utmost care. This\nseemed to me to be an admirable excuse for my refusal, but served merely to increase their enthusiasm.\nThey urged that previous writers on the subject had\nexpressed different and at times contradictory\nopinions, between which it was very difficult to\nchoose. They thought therefore that they were\njustified in imposing on me the task, if not of\ndiscovering original views, at least of passing definite\njudgment on those expressed by my predecessors. I was moved to comply not so much because I\nfelt confidence that I was equal to the task, as because I had a certain compunction about refusing.\nThe subject proved more extensive than I had first\nimagined; but finally I volunteered to shoulder a\ntask which was on a far larger scale than that which\nI was originally asked to undertake. I wished on\nthe one hand to oblige my very good friends beyond\ntheir requests, and on the other to avoid the beaten\ntrack and the necessity of treading where others\nhad gone before. For almost all others who have\nwritten on the art of oratory have started with the\nassumption that their readers were perfect in all\nother branches of education and that their own task\nwas merely to put the finishing touches to their\nrhetorical training; this is due to the fact that they\neither despised the preliminary stages of education\nor thought that they were not their concern, since\nthe duties of the different branches of education\nare distinct one from another, or else, and this\nis nearer the truth, because they had no hope of\nmaking a remunerative display of their talent in\ndealing with subjects, which, although necessary,\nare far from being showy just as in architecture it\nis the superstructure and not the foundations which\nattracts the eye. I on the other hand hold that the\nart of oratory includes all that is essential for the\ntraining of an orator, and that it is impossible to reach\nthe summit in any subject unless we have first passed\nthrough all the elementary stages. I shall not therefore refuse to stoop to the consideration of those\nminor details, neglect of which may result in there\nbeing no opportunity for more important things, and\npropose to mould the studies of my orator from infancy, on the assumption that his whole education has\nbeen entrusted to my charge. This work I dedicate to you, Marcellus Victorius. You have been the truest\nof friends to me and you have shown a passionate\nenthusiasm for literature. But good as these reasons\nare, they are not the only reasons that lead me to\nregard you as especially worthy of such a pledge of\nour mutual affection. There is also the consideration\nthat this book should prove of service in the\neducation of your son Geta, who, young though he\nis, already shows clear promise of real talent. It has\nbeen my design to lead my reader from the very\ncradle of speech through all the stages of education\nwhich can be of any service to our budding orator\ntill we have reached the very summit of the art. I\nhave been all the more desirous of so doing because\ntwo books on the art of rhetoric are at present\ncirculating under my name, although never published\nby me or composed for such a purpose. One is a\ntwo days' lecture which was taken down by the boys\nwho were my audience. The other consists of such\nnotes as my good pupils succeeded in taking down\nfrom a course of lectures on a somewhat more\nextensive scale I appreciate their kindness, but\nthey showed an excess of enthusiasm and a certain\nlack of discretion in doing my utterances the honour\nof publication. Consequently in the present work\nalthough some passages remain the same, you will\nfind many alterations and still more additions, while\nthe whole theme will be treated with greater system\nand with as great perfection as lies within my\npower. My aim, then, is the education of the perfect\norator. The first essential for such an one is that he\nshould be a good man, and consequently we demand\nof him not merely the possession of exceptional gifts of speech, but of all the excellences of character\nas well. For I will not admit that the principles of\nupright and honourable living should, as some have\nheld, be regarded as the peculiar concern of philosophy. The man who can really play his part as a\ncitizen and is capable of meeting the demands both\nof public and private business, the man who can\nguide a state by his counsels, give it a firm basis by\nhis legislation and purge its vices by his decisions as\na judge, is assuredly no other than the orator of our\nquest. Wherefore, although I admit I shall make\nuse of certain of the principles laid down in philosophical textbooks, I would insist that such principles\nhave a just claim to form part of the subject-matter\nof this work and do actually belong to the art of\noratory. I shall frequently be compelled to speak of\nsuch virtues as courage, justice, self-control; in fact\nscarcely a case comes up in which some one of these\nvirtues is not involved; every one of them requires\nillustration and consequently makes a demand on\nthe imagination and eloquence of the pleader. I\nask you then, can there be any doubt that, wherever\nimaginative power and amplitude of diction are required, the orator has a specially important part to\nplay These two branches of knowledge were, as\nCicero has clearly shown, so closely united, not\nmerely in theory but in practice, that the same men\nwere regarded as uniting the qualifications of orator\nand philosopher. Subsequently this single branch\nof study split up into its component parts, and\nthanks to the indolence of its professors was regarded as consisting of several distinct subjects.\nAs soon as speaking became a means of livelihood\nand the practice of making an evil use of the blessings of eloquence came into vogue, those who\nhad a reputation for eloquence ceased to study moral\nphilosophy, and ethics, thus abandoned by the\norators, became the prey of weaker intellects. As\na consequence certain persons, disdaining the toil of\nlearning to speak well, returned to the task of\nforming character and establishing rules of life and\nkept to themselves what is, if we must make a\ndivision, the better part of philosophy, but presumptuously laid claim to the sole possession of the\ntitle of philosopher, a distinction which neither the\ngreatest generals nor the most famous statesmen\nand administrators have ever dared to claim for themselves. For they preferred the performance to the\npromise of great deeds. I am ready to admit that\nmany of the old philosophers inculcated the most excellent principles and practised what they preached.\nBut in our own day the name of philosopher has\ntoo often been the mask for the worst vices. For\ntheir attempt has not been to win the name of\nphilosopher by virtue and the earnest search for\nwisdom; instead they have sought to disguise the\ndepravity of their characters by the assumption\nof a stern and austere mien accompanied by the\nwearing of a garb differing from that of their fellow\nmen. Now as a matter of fact we all of us frequently\nhandle those themes which philosophy claims for its\nown. Who, short of being an utter villain, does not\nspeak of justice, equity and virtue Who and even\ncommon country-folk are no exception does not\nmake some inquiry into the causes of natural phenomena As for the special uses and distinctions of\nwords, they should be a subject of study common to\nall who give any thought to the meaning of language. But it is surely the orator who will have the greatest\nmastery of all such departments of knowledge and\nthe greatest power to express it in words. And if ever\nhe had reached perfection, there would be no need\nto go to the schools of philosophy for the precepts of\nvirtue. As things stand, it is occasionally necessary\nto have recourse to those authors who have, as I\nsaid above, usurped the better part of the art of\noratory after its desertion by the orators and to\ndemand back what is ours by right, not with a view\nto appropriating their discoveries, but to show them\nthat they have appropriated what in truth belonged\nto others. Let our ideal orator then be such as to\nhave a genuine title to the name of philosopher it\nis not sufficient that he should be blameless in point\nof character for I cannot agree with those who hold\nthis opinion he must also be a thorough master of\nthe science and the art of speaking, to an extent\nthat perhaps no orator has yet attained. Still we\nmust none the less follow the ideal, as was done by\nnot a few of the ancients, who, though they refused\nto admit that the perfect sage had yet been found,\nnone the less handed down precepts of wisdom for\nthe use of posterity. Perfect eloquence is assuredly\na reality, which is not beyond the reach of human\nintellect. Even if we fail to reach it, those whose\naspirations are highest, will attain to greater heights\nthan those who abandon themselves to premature\ndespair of ever reaching the goal and halt at the\nvery foot of the ascent. I have therefore all the juster claim to indulgence,\nif I refuse to pass by those minor details which are\nnone the less essential to my task. My first book\nwill be concerned with the education preliminary to the duties of the teacher of rhetoric. My second will\ndeal with the rudiments of the schools of rhetoric\nand with problems connected with the essence of\nrhetoric itself. The next five will be concerned\nwith Invention, in which I include Arrangement.\nThe four following will be assigned to Eloquence,\nunder which head I include Memory and Delivery.\nFinally there will be one book in which our complete orator will be delineated; as far as my feeble\npowers permit, I shall discuss his character, the\nrules which should guide him in undertaking,\nstudying and pleading cases, the style of his eloquence, the time at which he should cease to plead\ncases and the studies to which he should devote\nhimself after such cessation. In the course of these\ndiscussions I shall deal in its proper place with\nthe method of teaching by which students will\nacquire not merely a knowledge of those things\nto which the name of art is restricted by certain\ntheorists, and will not only come to understand the\nlaws of rhetoric, but will acquire that which will\nincrease their powers of speech and nourish their\neloquence. For as a rule the result of the dry textbooks on the art of rhetoric is that by straining\nafter excessive subtlety they impair and cripple\nall the nobler elements of style, exhaust the lifeblood of the imagination and leave but the bare\nbones, which, while it is right and necessary that\nthey should exist and be bound each to each by\ntheir respective ligaments, require a covering of flesh\nas well. I shall therefore avoid the precedent set\nby the majority and shall not restrict myself to this\nnarrow conception of my theme, but shall include in\nmy twelve books a brief demonstration of everything which may seem likely to contribute to the education of an orator. For if I were to attempt to say\nall that might be said on each subject, the book\nwould never be finished. There is however one point which I must emphasise before I begin, which is this. Without\nnatural gifts technical rules are useless. Consequently the student who is devoid of talent will\nderive no more profit from this work than barren\nsoil from a treatise on agriculture. There are, it is\ntrue, other natural aids, such as the possession of a\ngood voice and robust lungs, sound health, powers of\nendurance and grace, and if these are possessed only\nto a moderate extent, they may be improved by\nmethodical training. In some cases, however, these\ngifts are lacking to such an extent that their absence\nis fatal to all such advantages as talent and study\ncan confer, while, similarly, they are of no profit in\nthemselves unless cultivated by skilful teaching, persistent study and continuous and extensive practice\nin writing, reading and speaking. I have made my remarks on this stage of\neducation as brief as possible, making no attempt to\nsay everything, for the theme is infinite, but confining myself to the most necessary points. I will\nnow proceed briefly to discuss the remaining arts in\nwhich I think boys ought to be instructed before\nbeing handed over to the teacher of rhetoric for it is by such studies that the course of education described by the Greeks as or general\neducation will be brought to its full completion. For there are other subjects of education which\nmust be studied simultaneously with literature.\nThese being independent studies are capable of completion without a knowledge of oratory, while on the\nother hand they cannot by themselves produce an\norator. The question has consequently been raised\nas to whether they are necessary for this purpose. What, say some, has the knowledge of the way to\ndescribe an equilateral triangle on a given straight\nline got to do with pleading in the law-courts or\nspeaking in the senate Will an acquaintance with\nthe names and intervals of the notes of the lyre help\nan orator to defend a criminal or direct the policy\nof his country They will perhaps produce a long\nlist of orators who are most effective in the courts\nbut have never sat under a geometrician and whose\nunderstanding of music is confined to the pleasure\nwhich their ears, like those of other men, derive\nfrom it. To such critics I reply, and Cicero frequently\nmakes the same remark in his Orator, that I am\nnot describing any orator who actually exists or has\nexisted, but have in my mind's eye an ideal orator,\nperfect down to the smallest detail. For when the\nphilosophers describe the ideal sage who is to be\nconsummate in all knowledge and a very god incarnate, as they say, they would have him receive\ninstruction not merely in the knowledge of things\nhuman and divine, but would also lead him through\na course of subjects, which in themselves are comparatively trivial, as for instance the elaborate\nsubtleties of formal logic not that acquaintance with the so called or problems\ncan make a man wise, but because it is important that he should never trip even in the\nsmallest trifles. So too the teacher of geometry,\nmusic or other subjects which I would class with\nthese, will not be able to create the perfect orator\nwho like the philosopher ought to be a wise man,\nbut none the less these arts will assist in his perfection. I may draw a parallel from the use of antidotes\nand other remedies applied to the eyes or to wounds.\nWe know that these are composed of ingredients\nwhich produce many and sometimes contrary effects,\nbut mixed together they make a single compound\nresembling no one of its component parts, but\nderiving its peculiar properties from all so too dumb\ninsects produce honey, whose taste is beyond the\nskill of man to imitate, from different kinds of flowers\nand juices. Shall we marvel then, if oratory, the\nhighest gift of providence to man, needs the assistance\nof many arts, which, although they do not reveal or\nintrude themselves in actual speaking, supply hidden\nforces and make their silent presence felt it will be urged Granted, but I am in quest of an orator. Yes, but we shall\nnever attain completeness, if minor details be\nlacking. And it will be agreed that though our\nideal of perfection may dwell on a height that is hard\nto gain, it is our duty to teach all we know, that\nachievement may at least come somewhat nearer\nthe goal. But why should our courage fail The\nperfect orator is not contrary to the laws of nature,\nand it is cowardly to despair of anything that is\nwithin the bounds of possibility. For myself I should be ready to accept the verdict\nof antiquity. Who is ignorant of the fact that\nmusic, of which I will speak first, was in ancient\ntimes the object not merely of intense study but of\nveneration in fact Orpheus and Linus, to mention\nno others, were regarded as uniting the roles of musician, poet and philosopher. Both were of divine\norigin, while the former, because by the marvel of\nhis music he soothed the savage breast, is recorded\nto have drawn after him not merely beasts of the\nwild, but rocks and trees. So too Timagenes\nasserts that music is the oldest of the arts related to\nliterature, a statement which is confirmed by the testimony of the greatest of poets in whose songs we read\nthat the praise of heroes and of gods were sung to\nthe music of the lyre at the feasts of kings. Does not\nlopas, the Vergilian bard, sing and the like whereby the supreme poet manifests most clearly that music is united with the\nknowledge even of things divine. If this be admitted, music will be a necessity even for an orator,\nsince those fields of knowledge, which were annexed\nby philosophy on their abandonment by oratory,\nonce were ours and without the knowledge of all\nsuch things there can be no perfect eloquence. There can in any case be no doubt that some of\nthose men whose wisdom is a household word have\nbeen earnest students of music Pythagoras for\ninstance and his followers popularised the belief,\nwhich they no doubt had received from earlier\nteachers, that the universe is constructed on the\nsame principles which were afterwards imitated in the construction of the lyre, and not content merely\nwith emphasising that concord of discordant elements\nwhich they style harmony attributed a sound to the\nmotions of the celestial bodies. As for Plato, there\nare certain passages in his works, more especially in\nthe Timaeus, which are quite unintelligible to those\nwho have not studied the theory of music. But\nwhy speak only of the philosophers, whose master,\nSocrates, did not blush to receive instruction in playing the lyre even when far advanced in years It is\nrecorded that the greatest generals played on the\nlyre and the pipe, and that the armies of Sparta were\nfired to martial ardour by the strains of music. And\nwhat else is the function of the horns and trumpets\nattached to our legions The louder the concert of\ntheir notes, the greater is the glorious supremacy of\nour arms over all the nations of the earth. It was\nnot therefore without reason that Plato regarded the\nknowledge of music as necessary to his ideal statesman or politician, as he calls him; while the leaders\neven of that school, which in other respects is the\nstrictest and most severe of all schools of philosophy,\nheld that the wise man might well devote some of\nhis attention to such studies. Lycurgus himself, the\nfounder of the stern laws of Sparta, approved of the\ntraining supplied by music. Indeed nature itself\nseems to have given music as a boon to men to lighten\nthe strain of labour even the rower in the galleys\nis cheered to effort by song. Nor is this function of\nmusic confined to cases where the efforts of a number\nare given union by the sound of some sweet voice\nthat sets the tune, but even solitary workers find\nsolace at their toil in artless song. So far I have\nattempted merely to sound the praises of the noblest of arts without bringing it into connexion with the\neducation of an orator. I will therefore pass by the\nfact that the art of letters and that of music were\nonce united indeed Archytas and Euenus held\nthat the former was subordinate to the latter, while\nwe know that the same instructors were employed\nfor the teaching of both from Sophron, a writer of\nfarces, it is true, but so highly esteemed by Plato,\nthat he is believed to have had Sophron's works\nunder his pillow on his deathbed the same fact is\nproved by the case of Eupolis, who makes Prodamus\nteach both music and literature, and whose Maricas,\nwho was none other than Hyperbolus in disguise,\nasserts that he knows nothing of music but letters.\nAristophanes again in more than one of his plays\nshows that boys were trained in music from remote\nantiquity, while in the Hypobolimaeus of Menander\nan old man, when a father claims his son from him,\ngives an account of all expenses incurred on behalf\nof the boy's education and states that he has paid\nout large sums to musicians and geometricians. From the importance thus given to music also originated the custom of taking a lyre round the company\nafter dinner, and when on such an occasion Themistocles confessed that he could not play, his education\nwas to quote the words of Cicero Even at the banquets of our own forefathers\nit was the custom to introduce the pipe and lyre, and\neven the hymn of the Salii has its tune. These\npractices were instituted by King Numa and clearly\nprove that not even those whom we regard as rude\nwarriors, neglected the study of music, at least in so\nfar as the resources of that age allowed. Finally\nthere was actually a proverb among the Greeks, that the uneducated were far from the company of\nthe Muses and Graces. But let us discuss the\nadvantages which our future orator may reasonably\nexpect to derive from the study of Music. Music has two modes of expression in the voice\nand in the body; for both voice and body require\nto be controlled by appropriate rules. Aristoxenus\ndivides music, in so far as it concerns the voice, into\nrhythm and melody, the one consisting in measure,\nthe latter in sound and song. Now I ask you whether\nit is not absolutely necessary for the orator to be\nacquainted with all these methods of expression\nwhich are concerned firstly with gesture, secondly\nwith the arrangement of words and thirdly with the\ninflexions of the voice, of which a great variety are\nrequired in pleading. Otherwise we must assume\nthat structure and the euphonious combination of\nsounds are necessary only for poetry, lyric and otherwise, but superfluous in pleading, or that unlike\nmusic, oratory has no interest in the variation of\narrangement and sound to suit the demands of the\ncase. But eloquence does vary both tone and rhythm,\nexpressing sublime thoughts with elevation, pleasing\nthoughts with sweetness, and ordinary with gentle\nutterance, and in every expression of its art is in\nsympathy with the emotions of which it is the mouthpiece. It is by the raising, lowering or inflexion of\nthe voice that the orator stirs the emotions of his\nhearers, and the measure, if I may repeat the term,\nof voice or phrase differs according as we wish\nto rouse the indignation or the pity of the judge.\nFor, as we know, different emotions are roused even\nby the various musical instruments, which are\nincapable of reproducing speech. Further the motion of the body must be suitable and becoming,\nor as the Greeks call it eurythmic, and this can only\nbe secured by the study of music. This is a most\nimportant department of eloquence, and will receive\nseparate treatment in this work. To proceed, an\norator will assuredly pay special attention to his\nvoice, and what is so specially the concern of music\nas this Here too I must not anticipate a later\nsection of this work, and will content myself by\nciting the example of Gaius Gracchus, the leading\norator of his age, who during his speeches had a\nmusician standing behind him with a pitchpipe, or\ntonarion as the Greeks call it, whose duty it was to\ngive him the tones in which his voice was to be\npitched. Such was the attention which he paid to\nthis point even in the midst of his most turbulent\nspeeches, when he was terrifying the patrician party\nand even when he had begun to fear their power.\nI should like for the benefit of the uninstructed,\nthose as the saying\nis, to remove all doubts as to the value of music. They will at any rate admit that the poets should be\nread by our future orator. But can they be read\nwithout some knowledge of music Or if any of\nmy critics be so blind as to have some doubts about\nother forms of poetry, can the lyric poets at any\nrate be read without such knowledge If there\nwere anything novel in my insistence on the study\nof music, I should have to treat the matter at\ngreater length. But in view of the fact that the\nstudy of music has, from those remote times when\nChiron taught Achilles down to our own day, continued to be studied by all except those who\nhave a hatred for any regular course of study, it would be a mistake to seem to cast any doubt upon\nits value by showing an excessive zeal in its defence. It will, however, I think be sufficiently clear from\nthe examples I have already quoted, what I regard\nas the value and the sphere of music in the training\nof an orator. Still I think I ought to be more\nemphatic than I have been in stating that the music\nwhich I desire to see taught is not our modern music,\nwhich has been emasculated by the lascivious melodies of our effeminate stage and has to no small\nextent destroyed such manly vigour as we still\npossessed. No, I refer to the music of old which was\nemployed to sing the praises of brave men and was\nsung by the brave themselves. I will have none\nof your psalteries and viols, that are unfit even for\nthe use of a modest girl. Give me the knowledge\nof the principles of music, which have power to\nexcite or assuage the emotions of mankind. We\nare told that Pythagoras on one occasion, when some\nyoung men were led astray by their passions to\ncommit an outrage on a respectable family, calmed\nthem by ordering the piper to change her strain to a\nspondaic measure, while Chrysippus selects a special\ntune to be used by nurses to entice their little charges\nto sleep. Further I may point out that among the\nfictitious themes employed in declamation is one,\ndoing no little credit to its author's learning, in\nwhich it is supposed that a piper is accused of manslaughter because he had played a tune in the Phrygian mode as an accompaniment to a sacrifice, with\nthe result that the person officiating went mad and\nflung himself over a precipice. If an orator is\nexpected to declaim on such a theme as this, which\ncannot possibly be handled without some knowledge of music, how can my critics for all their prejudice\nfail to agree that music is a necessary element in\nthe education of an orator As regards geometry, it is granted that portions of\nthis science are of value for the instruction of children\nfor admittedly it exercises their minds, sharpens\ntheir wits and generates quickness of perception.\nBut it is considered that the value of geometry\nresides in the process of learning, and not as with\nother sciences in the knowledge thus acquired.\nSuch is the general opinion. But it is not without\ngood reason that some of the greatest men have\ndevoted special attention to this science. Geometry\nhas two divisions; one is concerned with numbers,\nthe other with figures. Now knowledge of the former\nis a necessity not merely to the orator, but to any\none who has had even an elementary education.\nSuch knowledge is frequently required in actual\ncases, in which a speaker is regarded as deficient in education, I will not say if he hesitates\nin making a calculation, but even if he contradicts\nthe calculation which he states in words by making\nan uncertain or inappropriate gesture with his fingers.\nAgain linear geometry is frequently required in\ncases, as in lawsuits about boundaries and measurements. But geometry and oratory are related in a\nyet more important way than this. In the first\nplace logical development is one of the necessities\nof geometry. And is it not equally a necessity for\noratory Geometry arrives at its conclusions from\ndefinite premises, and by arguing from what is certain\nproves what was previously uncertain. Is not this\njust what we do in speaking Again are not the\nproblems of geometry almost entirely solved by the syllogistic method, a fact which makes the majority\nassert that geometry bears a closer resemblance to\nlogic than to rhetoric But even the orator will\nsometimes, though rarely, prove his point by formal\nlogic. For, if necessary, he will use the syllogism,\nand he will certainly make use of the enthymeme\nwhich is a rhetorical form of syllogism. Further\nthe most absolute form of proof is that which is\ngenerally known as linear demonstration. And what\nis the aim of oratory if not proof Again oratory\nsometimes detects falsehoods closely resembling the\ntruth by the use of geometrical methods. An\nexample of this may be found in connexion with\nnumbers in the so-called pseudographs, a favourite\namusement in our boyhood. But there are more\nimportant points to be considered. Who is there\nwho would not accept the following proposition But this is false, for everything depends on\nthe shape of the figure formed by these lines, and\nhistorians have been taken to task by geometricians\nfor believing the time taken to circumnavigate an\nisland to be a sufficient indication of its size. For\nthe space enclosed is in proportion to the perfection\nof the figure. Consequently if the bounding line\nto which we have referred form a circle, the most\nperfect of all plane figures, it will contain a greater\nspace than if the same length of line took the form\nof a square, while a square contains a greater space\nthan a triangle having the same total perimeter, and\nan equilateral triangle than a scalene triangle. But\nthere are other points which perhaps present greater difficulty. I will take an example which is easy\neven for those who have no knowledge of geometry.\nThere is scarcely anyone who does not know that\nthe Roman acre is 240 feet long and 120 feet\nbroad, and its total perimeter and the area enclosed\ncan easily be calculated. But a square of 180 feet\ngives the same perimeter, yet contains a much\nlarger area within its four sides. If the calculation\nprove irksome to any of my readers, he can learn the\nsame truth by employing smaller numbers. Take a\nten foot square its perimeter is forty feet and it\ncontains 100 square feet. But if the dimensions be\nfifteen feet by five, while the perimeter is the same,\nthe area enclosed is less by a quarter. On the other\nhand if we draw a parallelogram measuring nineteen\nfeet by one, the number of square feet enclosed will\nbe no greater than the number of linear feet making\nthe actual length of the parallelogram, though the\nperimeter will be exactly as that of the figure which\nencloses an area of 100 square feet. Consequently the\narea enclosed by four lines will decrease in proportion\nas we depart from the form of a square. It further\nfollows that it is perfectly possible for the space\nenclosed to be less, though the perimeter be greater.\nThis applies to plane figures only for even one who\nis no mathematician can see that, when we have to\nconsider hills or valleys, the extent of ground enclosed\nis greater than the sky over it. But geometry soars\nstill higher to the consideration of the system of\nthe universe for by its calculations it demonstrates\nthe fixed and ordained courses of the stars, and\nthereby we acquire the knowledge that all things\nare ruled by order and destiny, a consideration\nwhich may at times be of value to an orator. When Pericles dispelled the panic caused at Athens by the\neclipse of the sun by explaining the causes of the\nphenomenon, or Sulpicius Gallus discoursed on the\neclipse of the moon to the army of Lucius Paulus to\nprevent the soldiers being seized with terror at what\nthey regarded as a portent sent by heaven, did not\nthey discharge the function of an orator If Nicias\nhad known this when he commanded in Sicily, he\nwould not have shared the terror of his men nor lost\nthe finest army that Athens ever placed in the field.\nDion for instance when he came to Syracuse to overthrow the tyranny of Dionysius, was not frightened\naway by the occurrence of a similar phenomenon.\nHowever we are not concerned with the uses of\ngeometry in war and need not dwell upon the fact\nthat Archimedes singlehanded succeeded in appreciably prolonging the resistance of Syracuse when it\nwas besieged. It will suffice for our purpose that\nthere are a number of problems which it is difficult\nto solve in any other way, which are as a rule solved\nby these linear demonstrations, such as the method\nof division, section to infinity, and the ratio of increase in velocity. From this we may conclude that,\nif as we shall show in the next book an orator has\nto speak on every kind of subject, he can under\nno circumstances dispense with a knowledge of\ngeometry. XI. The comic actor will also claim a certain\namount of our attention, but only in so far as our\nfuture orator must be a master of the art of delivery.\nFor I do not of course wish the boy, whom we are\ntraining to this end, to talk with the shrillness of a\nwoman or in the tremulous accents of old age. Nor\nfor that matter must he ape the vices of the drunkard, or copy the cringing manners of a slave,\nor learn to express the emotions of love, avarice or\nfear. Such accomplishments are not necessary to\nan orator and corrupt the mind, especially while it\nis still pliable and unformed. For repeated imitation passes into habit. Nor yet again must we\nadopt all the gestures and movements of the actor.\nWithin certain limits the orator must be a master of\nboth, but he must rigorously avoid staginess and all\nextravagance of facial expression, gesture and gait.\nFor if an orator does command a certain art in such\nmatters, its highest expression will be in the concealment of its existence. What then is the duty of the teacher whom\nwe have borrowed from the stage In the\nfirst place he must correct all faults of pronunciation, and see that the utterance is distinct,\nand that each letter has its proper sound.\nThere is an unfortunate tendency in the case of\nsome letters to pronounce them either too thinly\nor too fully, while some we find too harsh and fail to\npronounce sufficiently, substituting others whose\nsound is similar but somewhat duller. For instance,\nlambda is substituted for rho, a letter which was\nalways a stumbling-block to Demosthenes; our l\nand r have of course the same value. Similarly\nwhen c and g are not given their full value, they\nare softened into t and d. Again our teacher must\nnot tolerate the affected pronunciation of s with\nwhich we are painfully familiar, nor suffer words\nto be uttered from the depths of the throat or rolled out hollow-mouthed, or permit the natural\nsound of the voice to be over-laid with a fuller\nsound, a fault fatal to purity of speech; the\nGreeks give this peculiarity the name plastered over, a term applied to the\ntone produced by a pipe, when the stops which\nproduce the treble notes are closed, and a bass note\nis produced through the main aperture only. He\nwill also see that final syllables are not clipped, that\nthe quality of speech is continuously maintained,\nthat when the voice is raised, the strain falls upon\nthe lungs and not the mouth, and that gesture and\nvoice are mutually appropriate. He will also insist\nthat the speaker faces his audience, that the lips\nare not distorted nor the jaws parted to a grin,\nthat the face is not thrown back, nor the eyes fixed\non the ground, nor the neck slanted to left or right.\nFor there are a variety of faults of facial expression.\nI have seen many, who raised their brows whenever\nthe voice was called upon for an effort, others who\nwore a perpetual frown, and yet others who could\nnot keep their eyebrows level, but raised one\ntowards the top of the head and depressed the\nother till it almost closed the eye. These are\ndetails, but as I shall shortly show, they are of\nenormous importance, for nothing that is unbecoming\ncan have a pleasing effect. Our actor will also be required to show how a\nnarrative should be delivered, and to indicate the\nauthoritative tone that should be given to advice,\nthe excitement which should mark the rise of anger,\nand the change of tone that is characteristic of\npathos. The best method of so doing is to select\nspecial passages from comedy appropriate for the purpose, that is to say, resembling the speeches of\na pleader. These are not only most useful in training the delivery, but are admirably adapted to\nincrease a speaker's eloquence. These are the\nmethods to be employed while the pupil is too young\nto take in more advanced instruction; but when\nthe time has come for him to read speeches, and as\nsoon as he begins to appreciate their merits, he\nshould have a careful and efficient teacher at his\nside not merely to form his style of reading aloud,\nbut to make him learn select passages by heart and\ndeclaim them standing in the manner which actual\npleading would require thus he will simultaneously\ntrain delivery, voice and memory. I will not blame even those who give a certain\namount of time to the teacher of gymnastics. I am\nnot speaking of those, who spend part of their life\nin rubbing themselves with oil and part in winebibbing, and kill the mind by over-attention to the\nbody indeed, I would have such as these kept\nas far as possible from the boy whom we are\ntraining. But we give the same name to those who\nform gesture and motion so that the arms may be\nextended in the proper manner, the management of\nthe hands free from all trace of rusticity and\ninelegance, the attitude becoming, the movements\nof the feet appropriate and the motions of the head\nand eyes in keeping with the poise of the body. No\none will deny that such details form a part of the\nart of delivery, nor divorce delivery from oratory;\nand there can be no justification for disdaining to\nlearn what has got to be done, especially as\nchironomy, which, as the name shows, is the law of\ngesture, originated in heroic times and met with the approval of the greatest Greeks, not excepting\nSocrates himself, while it was placed by Plato among\nthe virtues of a citizen and included by Chrysippus\nin his instructions relative to the education of\nchildren. We are told that the Spartans even\nregarded a certain form of dance as a useful\nelement in military training. Nor again did the\nancient Romans consider such a practice as disgraceful this is clear from the fact that priestly and\nritual dances have survived to the present day, while\nCicero in the third book of his de Oratore quotes the\nwords of Crassus, in which he lays down the\nprinciple that the orator And such a method of training has persisted uncensured to our own time. In my\nopinion, however, such training should not extend\nbeyond the years of boyhood, and even boys should\nnot devote too much time to it. For I do not wish\nthe gestures of oratory to be modelled on those\nof the dance. But I do desire that such boyish\nexercises should continue to exert a certain influence, and that something of the grace which we\nacquired as learners should attend us in after life\nwithout our being conscious of the fact. The question is not infrequently asked, as\nto whether, admitting that these things ought to\nbe learned, it is possible for all of them to be\ntaught and taken in simultaneously. There are\nsome who say that this is impossible on the ground\nthat the mind is confused and tired by application\nto so many studies of different tendencies neither\nthe intelligence nor the physique of our pupils, nor the time at our disposal are sufficient, they say, and\neven though older boys may be strong enough, it is\na sin to put such a burden on the shoulders of childhood. These critics show an insufficient appreciation of the capacities of the human mind, which\nis so swift and nimble and versatile, that it cannot\nbe restricted to doing one thing only, but insists on\ndevoting its attention to several different subjects not\nmerely in one day, but actually at one and the\nsame time. Do not harpists simultaneously exert\nthe memory and pay attention to the tone and\ninflexions of the voice, while the right hand runs\nover certain strings and the left plucks, stops or\nreleases others, and even the foot is employed in\nbeating time, all these actions being performed at\nthe same moment Again, do not we ourselves,\nwhen unexpectedly called upon to plead, speak\nwhile we are thinking what we are to say next,\ninvention of argument, choice of words, rhythm,\ngesture, delivery, facial expression and movement all\nbeing required simultaneously If all these things\ncan be done with one effort in spite of their\ndiversity, why should we not divide our hours among\ndifferent branches of study We must remember\nthat variety serves to refresh and restore the mind,\nand that it is really considerably harder to work at\none subject without intermission. Consequently we\nshould give the pen a rest by turning to read, and\nrelieve the tedium of reading by changes of subject.\nHowever manifold our activities, in a certain sense\nwe come fresh to each new subject. Who can\nmaintain his attention, if he has to listen for a\nwhole day to one teacher harping on the same\nsubject, be it what it may Change of studies is like change of foods the stomach is refreshed by\ntheir variety and derives greater nourishment from\nvariety of viands. If my critics disagree, let them\nprovide me with an alternative method. Are we\nfirst to deliver ourselves up to the sole service of\nthe teacher of literature, and then similarly to the\nteacher of geometry, neglecting under the latter\nwhat was taught us by the former And then are\nwe to go on to the musician, forgetting all that we\nlearned before And when we study Latin literature, are we to do so to the exclusion of Greek In\nfine, to have done with the matter once and for all,\nare we to do nothing except that which last comes\nto our hand On this principle, why not advise\nfarmers not to cultivate corn, vines, olives and\norchard trees at the same time or from devoting\nthemselves simultaneously to pastures, cattle, gardens, bees and poultry Why do we ourselves daily\nallot some of our time to the business of the courts,\nsome to the demands of our friends, some to our\ndomestic affairs, some to the exercise of the body,\nand some even to our pleasures Any one of these\noccupations, if pursued without interruption, would\nfatigue us. So much easier is it to do many things\nthan to do one thing for a long time continuously. We need have no fear at any rate that boys will\nfind their work too exhausting there is no age more\ncapable of enduring fatigue. The fact may be surprising, but it can be proved by experiment. For\nthe mind is all the easier to teach before it is set. This\nmay be clearly proved by the fact that within two\nyears after a child has begun to form words correctly,\nhe can speak practically all without any pressure\nfrom outside. On the other hand how many years it takes for our newly-imported slaves to become\nfamiliar with the Latin language. Try to teach an\nadult to read and you will soon appreciate the force\nof the saying applied to those who do everything\nconnected with their art with the utmost skill Moreover boys stand the strain of\nwork better than young men. Just as small children\nsuffer less damage from their frequent falls, from\ntheir crawling on hands and knees and, a little later,\nfrom their incessant play and their running about\nfrom morn till eve, because they are so light in\nweight and have so little to carry, even so their\nminds are less susceptible of fatigue, because their\nactivity calls for less effort and application to study\ndemands no exertion of their own, since they are\nmerely so much plastic material to be moulded by\nthe teacher. And further owing to the general\npliability of childhood, they follow their instructors\nwith greater simplicity and without attempting to\nmeasure their own progress for as yet they do not\neven appreciate the nature of their work. Finally, as\nI have often noticed, the senses are less affected by\nmere hard work than they are by hard thinking. Moreover there will never be more time for such\nstudies, since at this age all progress is made through\nlistening to the teacher. Later when the boy has to\nwrite by himself, or to produce and compose something out of his own head, he will neither have the time\nnor the inclination for the exercises which we have\nbeen discussing. Since, then, the teacher of literature\nneither can nor ought to occupy the whole day, for\nfear of giving his pupil a distaste for work, what are\nthe studies to which the spare time should preferably\nbe devoted For I do not wish the student to wear himself out in such pursuits I would not have him sing\nor learn to read music or dive deep into the minuter\ndetails of geometry, nor need he be a finished actor in\nhis delivery or a dancer in his gesture if I did demand all these accomplishments, there would yet be\ntime for them; the period allotted to education is\nlong, and I am not speaking of duller wits. Why did\nPlato bear away the palm in all these branches of\nknowledge which in my opinion the future orator\nshould learn I answer, because he was not merely content with the teaching which Athens was able to provide or even with that of the Pythagoreans whom he\nvisited in Italy, but even approached the priests of\nEgypt and made himself thoroughly acquainted with\nall their secret lore. The plea of the difficulty of the subject is put\nforward merely to cloak our indolence, because we\ndo not love the work that lies before us nor seek to\nwin eloquence for our own because it is a noble art\nand the fairest thing in all the world, but gird up\nour loins for mercenary ends and for the winning of\nfilthy lucre. Without such accomplishments many may\nspeak in the courts and make an income; but it is\nmy prayer that every dealer in the vilest merchandise\nmay be richer than they and that the public crier\nmay find his voice a more lucrative possession. And\nI trust that there is not one even among my readers\nwho would think of calculating the monetary value\nof such studies. But he that has enough of the\ndivine spark to conceive the ideal eloquence, he who,\nas the great tragic poet says, regards as and seeks not the transitory gains of advocacy, but those stable and lasting\nrewards which his own soul and knowledge and contemplation can give, he will easily persuade himself to spend his time not, like so many, in the theatre\nor in the Campus Martius, in dicing or in idle talk,\nto say naught of the hours that are wasted in sleep\nor long drawn banqueting, but in listening rather to\nthe geometrician and the teacher of music. For by\nthis he will win a richer harvest of delight than can\never be gathered from the pleasures of the ignorant,\nsince among the many gifts of providence to man\nnot the least is this that the highest pleasure is the\nchild of virtue. But the attractions of my theme\nhave led me to say overmuch. Enough of those\nstudies in which a boy must be instructed, while he\nis yet too young to proceed to greater things My\nnext book will start afresh and will pass to the consideration of the duties of the teacher of rhetoric. I would, therefore, have a father conceive the\nhighest hopes of his son from the moment of his\nbirth. If he does so, he will be more careful about\nthe groundwork of his education. For there is\nabsolutely no foundation for the complaint that but\nfew men have the power to take in the knowledge\nthat is imparted to them, and that the majority are\nso slow of understanding that education is a waste\nof time and labour. On the contrary you will find\nthat most are quick to reason and ready to learn.\nReasoning comes as naturally to man as flying to\nbirds, speed to horses and ferocity to beasts of prey our minds are endowed by nature with such activity\nand sagacity that the soul is believed to proceed\nfrom heaven. Those who are dull and unteachable\nare as abnormal as prodigious births and monstrosities, and are but few in number. A proof of what\nI say is to be found in the fact that boys commonly\nshow promise of many accomplishments, and when\nsuch promise dies away as they grow up, this is\nplainly due not to the failure of natural gifts, but to\nlack of the requisite care. But, it will be urged,\nthere are degrees of talent. Undoubtedly, I reply,\nand there will be a corresponding variation in actual\naccomplishment but that there are any who gain\nnothing from education, I absolutely deny. The\nman who shares this conviction, must, as soon as he\nbecomes a father, devote the utmost care to fostering the promise shown by the son whom he destines\nto become an orator. Above all see that the child's nurse speaks\ncorrectly. The ideal, according to Chrysippus,\nwould be that she should be a philosopher failing\nthat he desired that the best should be chosen, as\nfar as possible. No doubt the most important point\nis that they should be of good character but they\nshould speak correctly as well. It is the nurse that\nthe child first hears, and her words that he will first\nattempt to imitate. And we are by nature most\ntenacious of childish impressions, just as the flavour\nfirst absorbed by vessels when new persists, and the\ncolour imparted by dyes to the primitive whiteness\nof wool is indelible. Further it is the worst\nimpressions that are most durable. For, while what\nis good readily deteriorates, you will never turn vice into virtue. Do not therefore allow the boy to\nbecome accustomed even in infancy to a style of\nspeech which he will subsequently have to unlearn. As regards parents, I should like to see them as\nhighly educated as possible, and I do not restrict this\nremark to fathers alone. We are told that the\neloquence of the Gracchi owed much to their\nmother Cornelia, whose letters even to-day testify to\nthe cultivation of her style. Laelia, the daughter\nof Gaius Laelius, is said to have reproduced the\nelegance of her father's language in her own speech,\nwhile the oration delivered before the triumvirs by\nHortensia, the daughter of Quintus Hortensius, is\nstill read and not merely as a compliment to her sex. And even those who have not had the fortune to\nreceive a good education should not for that reason\ndevote less care to their son's education; but should\non the contrary show all the greater diligence in\nother matters where they can be of service to their\nchildren. As regards the boys in whose company our budding\norator is to be brought up, I would repeat what\nI have said about nurses. As regards his paedagogi,\nI would urge that they should have had a thorough\neducation, or if they have not, that they should be\naware of the fact. There are none worse than\nthose, who as soon as they have progressed beyond\na knowledge of the alphabet delude themselves\ninto the belief that they are the possessors of real\nknowledge. For they disdain to stoop to the\ndrudgery of teaching, and conceiving that they\nhave acquired a certain title to authoritya frequent\nsource of vanity in such personsbecome imperious\nor even brutal in instilling a thorough dose of their own folly. Their misconduct is no less prejudicial\nto morals. We are, for instance, told by Diogenes\nof Babylon, that Leonides, Alexander's paedagogus,\ninfected his pupil with certain faults, which as a\nresult of his education as a boy clung to him even in\nhis maturer years when he had become the greatest\nof kings. If any of my readers regards me as somewhat\nexacting in my demands, I would ask him to reflect\nthat it is no easy task to create an orator, even\nthough his education be carried out under the most\nfavourable circumstances, and that further and\ngreater difficulties are still before us. For continuous application, the very best of teachers and\na variety of exercises are necessary. Therefore the\nrules which we lay down for the education of our\npupil must be of the best. If anyone refuses to be\nguided by them, the fault will lie not with the\nmethod, but with the individual. Still if it should\nprove impossible to secure the ideal nurse, the ideal\ncompanions, or the ideal paedagogus, I would insist\nthat there should be one person at any rate attached\nto the boy who has some knowledge of speaking\nand who will, if any incorrect expression should be\nused by nurse or paedagogus in the presence of\nthe child under their charge, at once correct the\nerror and prevent its becoming a habit. But it must\nbe clearly understood that this is only a remedy, and\nthat the ideal course is that indicated above. I prefer that a boy should begin with Greek,\nbecause Latin, being in general use, will be picked\nup by him whether we will or no; while the fact\nthat Latin learning is derived from Greek is a\nfurther reason for his being first instructed in the latter. I do not however desire that this principle\nshould be so superstitiously observed that he should\nfor long speak and learn only Greek, as is done in the\nmajority of cases. Such a course gives rise to many\nfaults of language and accent; the latter tends to\nacquire a foreign intonation, while the former\nthrough force of habit becomes impregnated with\nGreek idioms, which persist with extreme obstinacy\neven when we are speaking another tongue. The\nstudy of Latin ought therefore to follow at no great\ndistance and in a short time proceed side by side\nwith Greek. The result will be that, as soon as we\nbegin to give equal attention to both languages,\nneither will prove a hindrance to the other. Some hold that boys should not be taught to\nread till they are seven years old, that being the\nearliest age at which they can derive profit from\ninstruction and endure the strain of learning. Most\nof them attribute this view to Hesiod, at least such\nas lived before the time of Aristophanes the grammarian, who was the first to deny that the Hypothecae, in which this opinion is expressed, was the\nwork of that poet. But other authorities, among\nthem Eratosthenes, give the same advice. Those\nhowever who hold that a child's mind should not be\nallowed to lie fallow for a moment are wiser.\nChrysippus, for instance, though he gives the nurses\na three years' reign, still holds the formation of\nthe child's mind on the best principles to be a part\nof their duties. Why, again, since children are\ncapable of moral training, should they not be\ncapable of literary education I am well aware\nthat during the whole period of which I am speaking\nwe can expect scarcely the same amount of progress that one year will effect afterwards. Still those who\ndisagree with me seem in taking this line to spare\nthe teacher rather than the pupil. What better\noccupation can a child have so soon as he is able to\nspeak And he must be kept occupied somehow or\nother. Or why should we despise the profit to be\nderived before the age of seven, small though it be\nFor though the knowledge absorbed in the previous\nyears may be but little, yet the boy will be learning\nsomething more advanced during that year, in which\nhe would otherwise have been occupied with something more elementary. Such progress each successive year increases the total, and the time gained\nduring childhood is clear profit to the period of\nyouth. Further as regards the years which follow\nI must emphasise the importance of learning what\nhas to be learnt in good time. Let us not therefore\nwaste the earliest years there is all the less excuse\nfor this, since the elements of literary training are\nsolely a question of memory, which not only exists\neven in small children, but is specially retentive at\nthat age. I am not however so blind to differences of age\nas to think that the very young should be forced on\nprematurely or given real work to do. Above all\nthings we must take care that the child, who is not\nyet old enough to love his studies, does not come to\nhate them and dread the bitterness which he has\nonce tasted, even when the years of infancy are\nleft behind. His studies must be made an amusement he must be questioned and praised and\ntaught to rejoice when he has done well; sometimes\ntoo, when he refuses instruction, it should be given\nto some other to excite his envy, at times also he must be engaged in competition and should be\nallowed to believe himself successful more often than\nnot, while he should be encouraged to do his best by\nsuch rewards as may appeal to his tender years. These instructions may seem but trivialities in\nview of the fact that I am professing to describe the\neducation of an orator. But studies, like men, have\ntheir infancy, and as the training of the body which\nis destined to grow to the fulness of strength begins\nwhile the child is in his cradle and at his mother's\nbreast, so even the man who is destined to rise to\nthe heights of eloquence was once a squalling babe,\ntried to speak in stammering accents and was\npuzzled by the shapes of letters. Nor does the\nfact that capacity for learning is inadequate, prove\nthat it is not necessary to learn anything. No\none blames a father because he thinks that such\ndetails should on no account be neglected in the\ncase of his own son. Why then should he be criticised who sets down for the benefit of the public\nwhat he would be right to put into practice in his\nown house There is this further reason why he\nshould not be blamed. Small children are better\nadapted for taking in small things, and just as the\nbody can only be trained to certain flexions of the\nlimbs while it is young and supple, so the acquisition\nof strength makes the mind offer greater resistance\nto the acquisition of most subjects of knowledge. Would Philip of Macedon have wished that his son\nAlexander should be taught the rudiments of letters\nby Aristotle, the greatest philosopher of that age, or\nwould the latter have undertaken the task, if he had\nnot thought that even the earliest instruction is best\ngiven by the most perfect teacher and has real reference to the whole of education Let us assume\ntherefore that Alexander has been confided to our\ncharge and that the infant placed in our lap deserves\nno less attention than hethough for that matter\nevery man's child deserves equal attention. Would\nyou be ashamed even in teaching him the alphabet\nto point out some brief rules for his education At any rate I am not satisfied with the course\nwhich I note is usually adopted of teaching small\nchildren the names and order of the letters before\ntheir shapes. Such a practice makes them slow\nto recognise the letters, since they do not pay\nattention to their actual shape, preferring to be\nguided by what they have already learned by\nrote. It is for this reason that teachers, when\nthey think they have sufficiently familiarised their\nyoung pupils with the letters written in their\nusual order, reverse that order or rearrange it in\nevery kind of combination, until they learn to know\nthe letters from their appearance and not from\nthe order in which they occur. It will be best\ntherefore for children to begin by learning their\nappearance and names just as they do with men. The method, however, to which we have objected in\nteaching the alphabet, is unobjectionable when\napplied to syllables. I quite approve on the other\nhand of a practice which has been devised to\nstimulate children to learn by giving them ivory\nletters to play with, as I do of anything else that\nmay be discovered to delight the very young, the\nsight, handling and naming of which is a pleasure. As soon as the child has begun to know the\nshapes of the various letters, it will be no bad thing\nto have them cut as accurately as possible upon a board, so that the pen may be guided along the\ngrooves. Thus mistakes such as occur with wax\ntablets will be rendered impossible; for the pen\nwill be confined between the edges of the letters\nand will be prevented from going astray. Further\nby increasing the frequency and speed with which\nthey follow these fixed outlines we shall give steadiness to the fingers, and there will be no need to\nguide the child's hand with our own. The art of\nwriting well and quickly is not unimportant for our\npurpose, though it is generally disregarded by persons\nof quality. Writing is of the utmost importance\nin the study which we have under consideration and\nby its means alone can true and deeply rooted\nproficiency be obtained. But a sluggish pen delays\nour thoughts, while an unformed and illiterate hand\ncannot be deciphered, a circumstance which necessitates another wearisome task, namely the dictation of what we have written to a copyist. We shall\ntherefore at all times and in all places, and above all\nwhen we are writing private letters to our friends,\nfind a gratification in the thought that we have not\nneglected even this accomplishment. As regards syllables, no short cut is possible they\nmust all be learnt, and there is no good in putting\noff learning the most difficult; this is the general\npractice, but the sole result is bad spelling. Further\nwe must beware of placing a blind confidence in a\nchild's memory. It is better to repeat syllables and\nimpress them on the memory and, when he is\nreading, not to press him to read continuously or\nwith greater speed, unless indeed the clear and\nobvious sequence of letters can suggest itself without\nits being necessary for the child to stop to think. The syllables once learnt, let him begin to construct\nwords with them and sentences with the words. You will hardly believe how much reading is delayed\nby undue haste. If the child attempts more than\nhis powers allow, the inevitable result is hesitation,\ninterruption and repetition, and the mistakes which\nhe makes merely lead him to lose confidence in what\nhe already knows. Reading must therefore first be\nsure, then connected, while it must be kept slow for\na considerable time, until practice brings speed\nunaccompanied by error. For to look to the right,\nwhich is regularly taught, and to look ahead depends not so much on precept as on practice; since\nit is necessary to keep the eyes on what follows\nwhile reading out what precedes, with the resulting difficulty that the attention of the mind must\nbe divided, the eyes and voice being differently engaged. It will be found worth while, when the boy\nbegins to write out words in accordance with the\nusual practice, to see that he does not waste his\nlabour in writing out common words of everyday\noccurrence. He can readily learn the explanations\nor glosses, as the Greeks call them, of the more\nobscure words by the way and, while he is still engaged on the first rudiments, acquire what would\notherwise demand special time to be devoted to it.\nAnd as we are still discussing minor details, I would\nurge that the lines, which he is set to copy, should\nnot express thoughts of no significance, but convey\nsome sound moral lesson. He will remember such\naphorisms even when he is an old man, and the impression made upon his unformed mind will contribute\nto the formation of his character. He may also be\nentertained by learning the sayings of famous men and above all selections from the poets, poetry being\nmore attractive to children. For memory is most necessary to an orator, as I shall point out in its proper\nplace, and there is nothing like practice for strengthening and developing it. And at the tender age\nof which we are now speaking, when originality is\nimpossible, memory is almost the only faculty which\ncan be developed by the teacher. It will be worth\nwhile, by way of improving the child's pronunciation\nand distinctness of utterance, to make him rattle\noff a selection of names and lines of studied difficulty\nthey should be formed of a number of syllables\nwhich go ill together and should be harsh and\nrugged in sound the Greeks call them This sounds a trifling matter, but its omission will\nresult in numerous faults of pronunciation, which,\nunless removed in early years, will become a perverse\nand incurable habit and persist through life. But the time has come for the boy to grow up\nlittle by little, to leave the nursery and tackle his\nstudies in good earnest. This therefore is the place\nto discuss the question as to whether it is better to\nhave him educated privately at home or hand him\nover to some large school and those whom I may\ncall public instructors. The latter course has, I\nknow, won the approval of most eminent authorities\nand of those who have formed the national character\nof the most famous states. It would, however, be folly\nto shut our eyes to the fact that there are some who\ndisagree with this preference for public education\nowing to a certain prejudice in favour of private\ntuition. These persons seem to be guided in the\nmain by two principles. In the interests of morality\nthey would avoid the society of a number of human beings at an age that is specially liable to acquire\nserious faults I only wish I could deny the truth of\nthe view that such education has often been the\ncause of the most discreditable actions. Secondly\nthey hold that whoever is to be the boy's teacher, he\nwill devote his time more generously to one pupil\nthan if he has to divide it among several. The first\nreason certainly deserves serious consideration. If\nit were proved that schools, while advantageous\nto study, are prejudicial to morality, I should give\nmy vote for virtuous living in preference to even\nsupreme excellence of speaking. But in my opinion\nthe two are inseparable. I hold that no one can be\na true orator unless he is also a good man and,\neven if he could be, I would not have it so. I will\ntherefore deal with this point first. It is held that schools corrupt the morals. It is\ntrue that this is sometimes the case. But morals\nmay be corrupted at home as well. There are\nnumerous instances of both, as there are also of\nthe preservation of a good reputation under either\ncircumstance. The nature of the individual boy\nand the care devoted to his education make all the\ndifference. Given a natural bent toward evil or\nnegligence in developing and watching over modest\nbehaviour in early years, privacy will provide equal\nopportunity for sin. The teacher employed at\nhome may be of bad character, and there is just as\nmuch danger in associating with bad slaves as there\nis with immodest companions of good birth. On the\nother hand if the natural bent be towards virtue,\nand parents are not afflicted with a blind and torpid\nindifference, it is possible to choose a teacher of the\nhighest character and those who are wise will make this their first object, to adopt a method of education of the strictest kind and at the same time to\nattach some respectable man or faithful freedman to\ntheir son as his friend and guardian, that his unfailing companionship may improve the character\neven of those who gave rise to apprehension. Yet how easy were the remedy for such fears.\nWould that we did not too often ruin our children's\ncharacter ourselves We spoil them from the\ncradle. That soft upbringing, which we call kindness, saps all the sinews both of mind and body. If\nthe child crawls on purple, what will he not desire\nwhen he comes to manhood Before he can talk he\ncan distinguish scarlet and cries for the very best\nbrand of purple. We train their palates before we\nteach their lips to speak. They grow up in litters\nif they set foot to earth, they are supported by the\nhands of attendants on either side. We rejoice if\nthey say something over-free, and words which we\nshould not tolerate from the lips even of an Alexandrian page are greeted with laughter and a kiss.\nWe have no right to be surprised. It was we that\ntaught them they hear us use such words, they see\nour mistresses and minions; every dinner party is\nloud with foul songs, and things are presented to\ntheir eyes of which we should blush to speak.\nHence springs habit, and habit in time becomes\nsecond nature. The poor children learn these things\nbefore they know them to be wrong. They become\nluxurious and effeminate, and far from acquiring\nsuch vices at schools, introduce them themselves. I now turn to the objection that one master can\nlive more attention to one pupil. In the first place\nthere is nothing to prevent the principle of being combined with school\neducation. And even if such a combination should\nprove impossible, I should still prefer the broad\ndaylight of a respectable school to the solitude and\nobscurity of a private education. For all the best\nteachers pride themselves on having a large number\nof pupils and think themselves worthy of a bigger\naudience. On the other hand in the case of inferior teachers a consciousness of their own defects\nnot seldom reconciles them to being attached to a\nsingle pupil and playing the partfor it amounts to\nlittle moreof a mere paedagogus. But let us assume that influence, money or friendship succeed in securing a paragon of learning to\nteach the boy at home. Will he be able to devote\nthe whole day to one pupil Or can we demand\nsuch continuous attention on the part of the learner\nThe mind is as easily tired as the eye, if given no\nrelaxation. Moreover by far the larger proportion\nof the learner's time ought to be devoted to private\nstudy. The teacher does not stand over him while\nhe is writing or thinking or learning by heart. While\nhe is so occupied the intervention of anyone, be he\nwho he may, is a hindrance. Further, not all reading requires to be first read aloud or interpreted by\na master. If it did, how would the boy ever become\nacquainted with all the authors required of him A\nsmall time only is required to give purpose and\ndirection to the day's work, and consequently\nindividual instruction can be given to more than one\npupil. There are moreover a large number of\nsubjects in which it is desirable that instruction\nshould be given to all the pupils simultaneously.\nI say nothing of the analyses and declamations of the professors of rhetoric in such cases there is no\nlimit to the number of the audience, as each individual pupil will in any case receive full value. The voice of a lecturer is not like a dinner which\nwill only suffice for a limited number; it is like the\nsun which distributes the same quantity of light and\nheat to all of us. So too with the teacher of\nliterature. Whether he speak of style or expound\ndisputed passages, explain stories or paraphrase\npoems, everyone who hears him will profit by his\nteaching. But, it will be urged, a large class is\nunsuitable for the correction of faults or for explanation. It may be inconvenient one cannot hope for\nabsolute perfection; but I shall shortly contrast the\ninconvenience with the obvious advantages. Still I do not wish a boy to be sent where he will\nbe neglected. But a good teacher will not burden\nhimself with a larger number of pupils than he can\nmanage, and it is further of the very first importance that he should be on friendly and intimate\nterms with us and make his teaching not a duty\nbut a labour of love. Then there will never be\nany question of being swamped by the number of\nour fellow-learners. Moreover any teacher who has\nthe least tincture of literary culture will devote\nspecial attention to any boy who shows signs of\nindustry and talent; for such a pupil will redound\nto his own credit. But even if large schools are to\nbe avoided, a proposition from which I must dissent\nif the size be due to the excellence of the teacher,\nit does not follow that all schools are to be avoided.\nIt is one thing to avoid them, another to select the\nbest. Having refuted these objections, let me now explain my own views. It is above all things necessary that our future orator, who will have to live\nin the utmost publicity and in the broad daylight of\npublic life, should become accustomed from his\nchildhood to move in society without fear and\nhabituated to a life far removed from that of the\npale student, the solitary and recluse. His mind\nrequires constant stimulus and excitement, whereas\nretirement such as has just been mentioned induces\nlanguor and the mind becomes mildewed like things\nthat are left in the dark, or else flies to the opposite\nextreme and becomes puffed up with empty conceit;\nfor he who has no standard of comparison by which\nto judge his own powers will necessarily rate them\ntoo high. Again when the fruits of his study have\nto be displayed to the public gaze, our recluse is\nblinded by the sun's glare, and finds everything new\nand unfamiliar, for though he has learnt what is required to be done in public, his learning is but the\ntheory of a hermit. I say nothing of friendships\nwhich endure unbroken to old age having acquired\nthe binding force of a sacred duty for initiation\nin the same studies has all the sanctity of initiation\nin the same mysteries of religion. And where shall\nhe acquire that instinct which we call common\nfeeling, if he secludes himself from that intercourse\nwhich is natural not merely to mankind but even to\ndumb animals Further, at home he can only learn\nwhat is taught to himself, while at school he will\nlearn what is taught others as well. He will hear\nmany merits praised and many faults corrected every\nday he will derive equal profit from hearing the\nindolence of a comrade rebuked or his industry\ncommended. Such praise will incite him to emulation, he will think it a disgrace to be outdone by\nhis contemporaries and a distinction to surpass his\nseniors. All such incentives provide a valuable\nstimulus, and though ambition may be a fault in\nitself, it is often the mother of virtues. I remember\nthat my own masters had a practice which was not\nwithout advantages. Having distributed the boys\nin classes, they made the order in which they were\nto speak depend on their ability, so that the boy\nwho had made most progress in his studies had the\nprivilege of declaiming first. The performances\non these occasions were criticised. To win commendation was a tremendous honour, but the prize\nmost eagerly coveted was to be the leader of the\nclass. Such a position was not permanent. Once a\nmonth the defeated competitors were given a fresh\nopportunity of competing for the prize. Consequently success did not lead the victor to relax his\nefforts, while the vexation caused by defeat served\nas an incentive to wipe out the disgrace. I will\nventure to assert that to the best of my memory\nthis practice did more to kindle our oratorical ambitions than all the exhortations of our instructors,\nthe watchfulness of our paedagogi and the prayers of\nour parents. Further while emulation promotes\nprogress in the more advanced pupils, beginners who\nare still of tender years derive greater pleasure from\nimitating their comrades than their masters, just\nbecause it is easier. For children still in the elementary stages of education can scarce dare hope to\nreach that complete eloquence which they understand to be their goal their ambition will not soar\nso high, but they will imitate the vine which has to\ngrasp the lower branches of the tree on which it is trained before it can reach the topmost boughs. So\ntrue is this that it is the master's duty as well, if he\nis engaged on the task of training unformed minds\nand prefers practical utility to a more ambitious\nprogramme, not to burden his pupils at once with\ntasks to which their strength is unequal, but to curb\nhis energies and refrain from talking over the heads\nof his audience. Vessels with narrow mouths will\nnot receive liquids if too much be poured into them\nat a time, but are easily filled if the liquid is admitted in a gentle stream or, it may be, drop by\ndrop; similarly you must consider how much a\nchild's mind is capable of receiving the things\nwhich are beyond their grasp will not enter their\nminds, which have not opened out sufficiently to\ntake them in. It is a good thing therefore that a\nboy should have companions whom he will desire\nfirst to imitate and then to surpass thus he will be\nled to aspire to higher achievement. I would add\nthat the instructors themselves cannot develop the\nsame intelligence and energy before a single listener\nas they can when inspired by the presence of a\nnumerous audience. For eloquence depends in the main on the state\nof the mind, which must be moved, conceive images\nand adapt itself to suit the nature of the subject\nwhich is the theme of speech. Further the loftier\nand the more elevated the mind, the more powerful\nwill be the forces which move it consequently\npraise gives it growth and effort increase, and the\nthought that it is doing something great fills it with\njoy. The duty of stooping to expend that power of\nspeaking which has been acquired at the cost of such\neffort upon an audience of one gives rise to a silent feeling of disdain, and the teacher is ashamed to\nraise his voice above the ordinary conversational\nlevel. Imagine the air of a declaimer, or the voice\nof an orator, his gait, his delivery, the movements of\nhis body, the emotions of his mind, and, to go no\nfurther, the fatigue of his exertions, all for the sake\nof one listener Would he not seem little less than\na lunatic No, there would be no such thing as\neloquence, if we spoke only with one person at\na time. The skilful teacher will make it his first care,\nas soon as a boy is entrusted to him, to ascertain his\nability and character. The surest indication in\na child is his power of memory. The characteristics of a good memory are twofold it must be\nquick to take in and faithful to retain impressions\nof what it receives. The indication of next importance is the power of imitation for this is a\nsign that the child is teachable but he must imitate\nmerely what he is taught, and must not, for\nexample, mimic someone's gait or bearing or defects. For I have no hope that a child will turn\nout well who loves imitation merely for the purpose\nof raising a laugh. He who is really gifted will also\nabove all else be good. For the rest, I regard\nslowness of intellect as preferable to actual badness. But a good boy will be quite unlike the\ndullard and the sloth. My ideal pupil will absorb\ninstruction with ease and will even ask some\nquestions; but he will follow rather than anticipate\nhis teacher. Precocious intellects rarely produce\nsound fruit. By the precocious I mean those who\nperform small tasks with ease and, thus emboldened,\nproceed to display all their little accomplishments without being asked but their accomplishments are\nonly of the most obvious kind they string words together and trot them out boldly and undeterred by\nthe slightest sense of modesty. Their actual achievement is small, but what they can do they perform with\nease. They have no real power and what they have\nis but of shallow growth it is as when we cast\nseed on the surface of the soil it springs up too\nrapidly, the blade apes the loaded ear, and yellows\nere harvest time, but bears no grain. Such tricks\nplease us when we contrast them with the performer's age, but progress soon stops and our admiration withers away. Such indications once noted, the teacher must next\nconsider what treatment is to be applied to the mind\nof his pupil. There are some boys who are slack,\nunless pressed on; others again are impatient of\ncontrol some are amenable to fear, while others are\nparalysed by it in some cases the mind requires\ncontinued application to form it, in others this result\nis best obtained by rapid concentration. Give me\nthe boy who is spurred on by praise, delighted by\nsuccess and ready to weep over failure. Such an\none must be encouraged by appeals to his ambition;\nrebuke will bite him to the quick; honour will be a\nspur, and there is no fear of his proving indolent. Still, all our pupils will require some relaxation,\nnot merely because there is nothing in this world\nthat can stand continued strain and even unthinking\nand inanimate objects are unable to maintain their\nstrength, unless given intervals of rest, but because\nstudy depends on the good will of the student, a\nquality that cannot be secured by compulsion. Consequently if restored and refreshed by a holiday they will bring greater energy to their learning and\napproach their work with greater spirit of a kind\nthat will not submit to be driven. I approve of play\nin the young; it is a sign of a lively disposition; nor\nwill you ever lead me to believe that a boy who is\ngloomy and in a continual state of depression is ever\nlikely to show alertness of mind in his work, lacking\nas he does the impulse most natural to boys of his\nage. Such relaxation must not however be unlimited otherwise the refusal to give a holiday will\nmake boys hate their work, while excessive indulgence will accustom them to idleness. There are\nmoreover certain games which have an educational\nvalue for boys, as for instance when they compete\nin posing each other with all kinds of questions\nwhich they ask turn and turn about. Games\ntoo reveal character in the most natural way, at\nleast that is so if the teacher will bear in mind\nthat there is no child so young as to be unable to\nlearn to distinguish between right and wrong, and\nthat the character is best moulded, when it is still\nguiltless of deceit and most susceptible to instruction for once a bad habit has become engrained,\nit is easier to break than bend. There must be no\ndelay, then, in warning a boy that his actions must\nbe unselfish, honest, self-controlled, and we must\nnever forget the words of Virgil, I disapprove of flogging, although it is the regular\ncustom and meets with the acquiescence of Chrysippus, because in the first place it is a disgraceful\nform of punishment and fit only for slaves, and is in any case an insult, as you will realise if you imagine\nits infliction at a later age. Secondly if a boy is so\ninsensible to instruction that reproof is useless, he\nwill, like the worst type of slave, merely become\nhardened to blows. Finally there will be absolutely no\nneed of such punishment if the master is a thorough\ndisciplinarian. As it is, we try to make amends for\nthe negligence of the boy's paedagogus, not by\nforcing him to do what is right, but by punishing\nhim for not doing what is right. And though you\nmay compel a child with blows, what are you\nto do with him when he is a young man no longer\namenable to such threats and confronted with tasks\nof far greater difficulty Moreover when children\nare beaten, pain or fear frequently have results of\nwhich it is not pleasant to speak and which are\nlikely subsequently to be a source of shame, a shame\nwhich unnerves and depresses the mind and leads\nthe child to shun and loathe the light. Further if inadequate care is taken in the choices of respectable\ngovernors and instructors, I blush to mention the\nshameful abuse which scoundrels sometimes make\nof their right to administer corporal punishment or\nthe opportunity not infrequently offered to others\nby the fear thus caused in the victims. I will not\nlinger on this subject; it is more than enough if I\nhave made my meaning clear. I will content myself\nwith saying that children are helpless and easily\nvictimised, and that therefore no one should be given\nunlimited power over them. I will now proceed to\ndescribe the subjects in which the boy must be\ntrained, if he is to become an orator, and to indicate\nthe age at which each should be commenced. As soon as the boy has learned to read and write without difficulty, it is the turn for the teacher\nof literature. My words apply equally to Greek and\nLatin masters, though I prefer that a start should\nbe made with a Greek in either case the method\nis the same. This profession may be most briefly\nconsidered under two heads, the art of speaking\ncorrectly and the interpretation of the poets; but\nthere is more beneath the surface than meets the\neye. For the art of writing is combined with that of\nspeaking, and correct reading precedes interpretation, while in each of these cases criticism has its\nwork to perform. The old school of teachers indeed\ncarried their criticism so far that they were not\ncontent with obelising lines or rejecting books whose\ntitles they regarded as spurious, as though they\nwere expelling a supposititious child from the family\ncircle, but also drew up a canon of authors, from\nwhich some were omitted altogether. Nor is it\nsufficient to have read the poets only; every kind of\nwriter must be carefully studied, not merely for the\nsubject matter, but for the vocabulary; for words\noften acquire authority from their use by a particular\nauthor. Nor can such training be regarded as complete if it stop short of music, for the teacher of\nliterature has to speak of metre and rhythm nor\nagain if he be ignorant of astronomy, can he understand the poets; for they, to mention no further points,\nfrequently give their indications of time by reference\nto the rising and setting of the stars. Ignorance of\nphilosophy is an equal drawback, since there are\nnumerous passages in almost every poem based on\nthe most intricate questions of natural philosophy,\nwhile among the Greeks we have Empedocles and\namong our own poets Varro and Lucretius, all of whom have expounded their philosophies in verse. No small powers of eloquence also are required to\nenable the teacher to speak appropriately and\nfluently on the various points which have just been\nmentioned. For this reason those who criticise the\nart of teaching literature as trivial and lacking in\nsubstance put themselves out of court. Unless the\nfoundations of oratory are well and truly laid by\nthe teaching of literature, the superstructure will\ncollapse. The study of literature is a necessity for\nboys and the delight of old age, the sweet companion of our privacy and the sole branch of study\nwhich has more solid substance than display. The elementary stages of the teaching of literature must not therefore be despised as trivial. It is\nof course an easy task to point out the difference\nbetween vowels and consonants, and to subdivide the\nlatter into semivowels and mutes. But as the pupil\ngradually approaches the inner shrine of the sacred\nplace, he will come to realise the intricacy of the subject, an intricacy calculated not merely to sharpen the\nwits of a boy, but to exercise even the most profound\nknowledge and erudition. It is not every ear that\ncan appreciate the correct sound of the different\nletters. It is fully as hard as to distinguish the\ndifferent notes in music. But all teachers of literature will condescend to such minutiae they\nwill discuss for instance whether certain necessary\nletters are absent from the alphabet, not indeed\nwhen we are writing Greek words for then we\nborrow two letters from them, but in the case of\ngenuine Latin words for example in words such as\nseruus and uulgus we feel the lack of the Aeolic\ndigamma; there is also a sound intermediate between u and i, for we do not pronounce optimum as we do opimum, while in here the sound is neither exactly e or i. Again there is the question whether certain letters\nare not superfluous, not to mention the mark of the\naspirate, to which, if it is required at all, there\nshould be a corresponding symbol to indicate the\nopposite for instance k, which is also used as an\nabbreviation for certain nouns, and q, which, though\nslanted slightly more by us, resembles both in sound\nand shape the Greek koppa, now used by the Greeks\nsolely as a numerical sign there is also x, the last\nletter of our own alphabet, which we could dispense\nwith as easily as with psi. Again the teacher of\nliterature will have to determine whether certain\nvowels have not been consonantalised. For instance\niam and etiam are both spelt with an i, uos and tuos\nboth with a u. Vowels, however, when joined as\nvowels, either make one long vowel compare the\nobsolete method of indicating a long vowel by\ndoubling it as the equivalent of the circumflex,\nor a diphthong, though some hold that even three\nvowels can form a single syllable; this however is\nonly possible if one or more assume the role of\nconsonants. He will also inquire why it is that\nthere are two vowels which may be repeated, while\na consonant can only be followed and modified by\na different consonant. But i can follow i for\nconiicit is derived from iacit so too does u, witness the modern spelling of seruus and uulgus. He\nshould also know that Cicero preferred to write\naiio and Maaiiam with a double i; in that case one of them is consonantalised. A boy therefore must\nlearn both the peculiarities and the common characteristics of letters and must know how they are\nrelated to each other. Nor must he be surprised\nthat scabillum is formed from scamnus or that a\ndouble-edged axe should be called bipennis from\npinnus,  for I would not have him fall into\nthe same error as those who, supposing this word to\nbe derived from his and pennae, think that it is a\nmetaphor from the wings of birds. He must not be content with knowing only those\nchanges introduced by conjugation and prefixes,\nsuch as secat secuit, cadit excidit, caedit excdit, calcat\nexculcat, to which might be added lotus from lauare\nand again inlotus with a thousand others. He must\nlearn as well the changes that time has brought\nabout even in nominatives. For just as names like\nValesius and Fusius have become Valerius and Furius,\nso arbos, labos, vapos and even clamos and lases\nwere the original forms. And this same letter s,\nwhich has disappeared from these words, has itself\nin some cases taken the place of another letter. For\nour ancestors used to say mertare and pultare. They\nalso said fordeum and faedi, using f instead of the\naspirate as being a kindred letter. For the Greeks\nunlike us aspirate f like their own phi, as Cicero\nbears witness in the pro Fundanio, where he laughs at\na witness who is unable to pronounce the first letter\nof that name. In some cases again we have substituted b for other letters, as with Burrus, Bruges,\nand Belena. The same letter too has turned duellum\ninto bellum, and as a result some have ventured to\ncall the Duelii Belii. What of stlocus and stlites\nWhat of the connexion between t and d, a connexion which makes it less surprising that on some of\nthe older buildings of Rome and certain famous\ntemples we should find the names Alexanter and\nCassantra What again of the interchange of o\nand u, of which examples may be found in Hecoba,\nnotrix, Culcides and Pulixena, or to take purely Latin\nwords dederont and probaueront So too Odysseus,\nwhich the Aeolian dialect turned into Ulysseus, has\nbeen transformed by us into Ulixes. Similarly e in\ncertain cases held the place that is now occupied\nby i, as in Menerua, leber, magester, and Dioue victore\nin place of Dioui victori. It is sufficient for me to\ngive a mere indication as regards these points, for I\nam not teaching, but merely advising those who\nhave got to teach. The next subject to which attention must be given is that of syllables, of which I will\nspeak briefly, when I come to deal with orthography. Following this the teacher concerned will note\nthe number and nature of the parts of speech,\nalthough there is some dispute as to their number. Earlier writers, among them Aristotle himself and\nTheodectes, hold that there are but three, verbs,\nnouns and convictions. Their view was that the\nforce of language resided in the verbs, and the\nmatter in the nouns for the one is what we speak,\nthe other that which we speak about, while the\nduty of the convinctions was to provide a link\nbetween the nouns and the verbs. I know that\nconjunction is the term in general use. But conviction\nseems to me to be the more accurate translation of\nthe Greek Gradually the number was\nincreased by the philosophers, more especially by\nthe Stoics articles were first added to the convinctions, then prepositions to nouns appellations were added, then the pronoun and finally the participle,\nwhich holds a middle position between the verb\nand the noun. To the verb itself was added the\nadverb. Our own language dispenses with the\narticles, which are therefore distributed among the\nother parts of speech. But interjections must be\nadded to those already mentioned. Others however follow good authority in asserting that there\nare eight parts of speech. Among these I may\nmention Aristarchus and in our own day Palaemon,\nwho classified the vocable or appellation as a species\nof the genus noun. Those on the other hand who\ndistinguish between the noun and the vocable, make\nnine parts of speech. But yet again there are\nsome who differentiate between the vocable and the\nappellation, saying that the vocable indicates concrete\nobjects which can be seen and touched, such as a or while an appellation is something\nimperceptible either to sight or touch or to both,\nsuch as the or They\nadded also the asseveration, such as and the\nderivative such as fasciatim. But of these classifications I do not approve. Whether we should translate by vocable or appellation, and whether\nit should be regarded as a species of noun, I leave\nto the decision of such as desire to express their\nopinion it is a matter of no importance. Boys should begin by learning to decline nouns\nand conjugate verbs otherwise they will never be\nable to understand the next subject of study. This\nadmonition would be superfluous but for the fact\nthat most teachers, misled by a desire to show rapid\nprogress, begin with what should really come at the\nend their passion for displaying their pupils' talents in connexion with the more imposing aspects of\ntheir work serves but to delay progress and their\nshort cut to knowledge merely lengthens the\njourney. And yet a teacher who has acquired\nsufficient knowledge himself and is ready to teach\nwhat he has learnedand such readiness is all too\nrarewill not be content with stating that nouns\nhave three genders or with mentioning those which\nare common to two or all three together. Nor\nagain shall I be in a hurry to regard it as a proof of\nreal diligence, if he points out that there are irregular nouns of the kind called epicene by the Greeks,\nin which one gender implies both, or which in spite\nof being feminine or neuter in form indicate males\nor females respectively, as for instance Muraena\nand Glycerium. A really keen and intelligent teacher\nwill inquire into the origin of names derived from\nphysical characteristics, such as Rufus or Longus,\nwhenever their meaning is obscure, as in the case of\nSulla, Burrus, Galba, Plautus, Pansa, Scaurus and the\nlike; of names derived from accidents of birth such\nas Agrippa, Opiter, Cordus and Postumus, and again of\nnames given after birth such as Vopiscus. Then there\nare names such as Cotta, Scipio, Laenas or Seranus,\nwhich originated in various ways. It will also be found\nthat names are frequently derived from races, places\nand many other causes. Further there are obsolete\nslave-names such as Marcipor or Publipor derived\nfrom the names of their owners. The teacher must\nalso inquire whether there is not room for a sixth case in Greek and a seventh in Latin. For when I\nsay the case is not a true\nablative in Latin nor a true dative in Greek. Again\nif we turn to verbs, who is so ill-educated as not to\nbe familiar with their various kinds and qualities,\ntheir different persons and numbers. Such subjects belong to the elementary school and the\nrudiments of knowledge. Some, however, will\nfind points undetermined by inflexion somewhat\nperplexing. For there are certain participles, about\nwhich there may be doubts as to whether they are\nreally nouns or verbs, since their meaning varies\nwith their use, as for example lectum and sapiens, while there are other verbs which resemble nouns,\nsuch as fraudator and nutritor. Again itur in antiquam\nsilvam is a peculiar usage. For there is no subject\nto serve as a starting point fletur is a similar example.\nThe passive may be used in different ways as for\ninstance in and in Yet a third usage is found in urbs habitatur, whence\nwe get phrases such as campus curritur and mare navigatur. Pransus and potus have a meaning which does\nnot correspond to their form. And what of those\nverbs which are only partially conjugated Some\nas for instance fero even suffer an entire change in\nthe perfect. Others are used only in the third person, such as licet and piget, while some resemble\nnouns tending to acquire an adverbial meaning; for\nwe say dictu and factu as we say noctu and diu,\nsince these words are participial though quite different\nfrom dicto and facto. Style has three kinds of excellence, correctness, lucidity and elegance for many include the\nall-important quality of appropriateness under the\nheading of elegance. Its faults are likewise threefold, namely the opposites of these excellences. The\nteacher of literature therefore must study the rules\nfor correctness of speech, these constituting the\nfirst part of his art. The observance of these rules\nis concerned with either one or more words. I must\nnow be understood to use verbum in its most general\nsense. It has of course two meanings; the one covers\nall the parts of which language is composed, as in\nthe line of Horace the other restricts it to a part of speech such as\nlego and scribo. To avoid this ambiguity, some\nauthorities prefer the terms voces, locutiones, dictiones. Individual words will either be native or imported,\nsimple or compound, literal or metaphorical, in\ncurrent use or newly-coined. A single word is more likely to be faulty than\nto possess any intrinsic merit. For though we\nmay speak of a word as appropriate, distinguished\nor sublime, it can possess none of these properties\nsave in relation to connected and consecutive speech;\nsince when we praise words, we do so because they\nsuit the matter. There is only one excellence that can be isolated for consideration, namely euphony,\nthe Greek term for our uocalitas that is to say that,\nwhen we are confronted with making a choice\nbetween two exact synonyms, we must select that\nwhich sounds best. In the first place barbarisms and solecisms must not\nbe allowed to intrude their offensive presence. These\nblemishes are however pardoned at times, because\nwe have become accustomed to them or because they\nhave age or authority in their favour or are near akin\nto positive excellences, since it is often difficult to distinguish such blemishes from figures of speech.1 The\nteacher therefore, that such slippery customers may\nnot elude detection, must seek to acquire a delicate\ndiscrimination; but of this I will speak later when\nI come to discuss figures of speech. For the present\nI will define barbarism as an offence occurring in\nconnexion with single words. Some of my readers\nmay object that such a topic is beneath the dignity\nof so ambitious a work. But who does not know\nthat some barbarisms occur in writing, others in\nspeaking For although what is incorrect in\nwriting will also be incorrect in speech, the converse\nis not necessarily true, inasmuch as mistakes in\nwriting are caused by addition or omission, substitution or transposition, while mistakes in speaking are\ndue to separation or combination of syllables, to\naspiration or other errors of sound. Trivial as these\npoints may seem, our boys are still at school and I\nam reminding their instructors of their duty. And\nif one of our teachers is lacking in education and\nhas done no more than set foot in the outer courts\nof his art, he will have to confine himself to the\nrules published in the elementary text-books the more learned teacher on the other hand will be in a\nposition to go much further first of all, for example,\nhe will point out that there are many different kinds\nof barbarism. One kind is due to race, such as the\ninsertion of a Spanish or African term; for instance\nthe iron tire of a wheel is called cantus, though\nPersius uses it as established in the Latin language;\nCatullus picked up ploxenum a box in the valley\nof the Po, while the author of the in Pollionem, be\nhe Labienus or Cornelius Gallus, imported casamo\nfrom Gaul in the sense of As for\nmastruca, which is Sardinian for a it\nis introduced by Cicero merely as an object of derision. Another kind of barbarism proceeds from the\nspeaker's temper for instance, we regard it as barbarous if a speaker use cruel or brutal language. A third and very common kind, of which anyone\nmay fashion examples for himself, consists in the\naddition or omission of a letter or syllable, or in the\nsubstitution of one for another or in placing one\nwhere it has no right to be. Some teachers however,\nto display their learning, are in the habit of picking\nout examples of barbarism from the poets and attacking the authors whom they are expounding for\nusing such words. A boy should however realize\nthat in poets such peculiarities are pardonable or\neven praiseworthy, and should therefore be taught\nless common instances. For Tinga of Placentia, if\nwe may believe Hortensius who takes him to task for\nit, committed two barbarisms in one word by saying\nprecula for pergula that is to say he substituted c\nfor g, and transposed r and e. On the other hand when Ennius writes Mettocoque Fufetioeo, where\nthe barbarism is twice repeated, he is defended on\nthe plea of poetic licence. Substitution is however\nsometimes admitted even in prose, as for instance\nwhen Cicero speaks of the army of Canopus which is\nlocally styled Canobus, while the number of authors\nwho have been guilty of transposition in writing\nTrasumennus for Tarsumennus has succeeded in standardising the error. Similar instances may be quoted.\nIf adsentior be regarded as the correct form, we must\nremember that Sisenna said adsentio, and that many\nhave followed him on the ground of analogy on\nthe other hand, if adsentio is the correct form, we\nmust remember that adsentior has the support of\ncurrent usage. And yet our fat fool, the fashionable\nschoolmaster, will regard one of these forms as an\nexample of omission or the other as an instance\nof addition. Again there are words which when\nused separately are undoubtedly incorrect, but\nwhen used in conjunction excite no unfavourable\ncomment. For instance dua and tre are barbarisms\nand differ in gender, but the words duapondo\nand trepondo have persisted in common parlance\ndown to our own day, and Messala shows that the\npractice is correct. It may perhaps seem absurd to\nsay that a barbarism, which is an error in a single\nword, may be made, like a solecism, by errors in\nconnexion with number or gender. But take on the\none hand scala stairs and scopa which literally\nmeans a twig, but is used in the sense of broom\nand on the other hand hordea barley and mulsa\nmead here we have substitution, omission and\naddition of letters, but the blemish consists in the\nformer case merely in the use of singular for plural, in the latter of plural for singular. Those on the\nother hand who have used the word gladia are guilty\nof a mistake in gender. I merely mention these as\ninstances I do not wish anyone to think that I\nhave added a fresh problem to a subject into which\nthe obstinacy of pedants has already introduced\nconfusion. The faults which arise in the course of actual\nspeaking require greater penetration on the part\nof the critic, since it is impossible to cite examples\nfrom writing, except in cases where they occur\nin poetry, as when the diphthong is divided into\ntwo syllables in Europai and Asiai; or when the\nopposite fault occurs, called synaeresis or synaloephe\nby the Greeks and complexio by ourselves as an\nexample I may quote the line of Publius Varro If this were prose, it would be possible to give\nthe letters their true syllabic value. I may mention\nas further anomalies peculiar to poetry the lengthening of a short syllable as in Italiam fato profugus,\nor the shortening of a long such as unius ob noxam\net furias; but in poetry we cannot label these as\nactual faults. Errors in sound on the other hand\ncan be detected by the ear alone; although in Latin,\nas regards the addition or omission of the aspirate,\nthe question may be raised whether this is an error\nwhen it occurs in writing; for there is some doubt\nwhether h is a letter or merely a breathing, practice\nhaving frequently varied in different ages. Older\nauthors used it but rarely even before vowels, saying\naedus or ircus, while its conjunction with consonants\nwas for a long time avoided, as in words such as Graccus or triumpus. Then for a short time it broke\nout into excessive use, witness such spelling as chorona,\nchenturia or praecho, which may still be read in certain\ninscriptions the well-known epigram of Catullus\nwill be remembered in this connexion. The spellings\nvehementer, comprehendere and mihi have lasted to our\nown day and among early writers, especially of\ntragedy, we actually find mehe for me in the older MSS. It is still more difficult to detect errors of tenor or\ntone I note that old writers spell the word tonor,\nas derived from the Greek , or of accent, styled\nprosody by the Greeks, such as the substitution of\nthe acute accent for the grave or the grave for the\nacute such an example would be the placing of the\nacute accent on the first syllable of Camillus, or the\nsubstitution of the grave for the circumflex in Cethegus,\nan error which results in the alteration of the\nquantity of the middle syllable, since it means\nmaking the first syllable acute; or again the substitution of the circumflex for the grave on the\nsecond syllable of Appi, where the contraction of\ntwo syllables into one circumflexed syllable involves\na double error. This, however, occurs far more frequently in Greek words such as Atrei, which in our\nyoung days was pronounced by the most learned of\nour elders with an acute accent on the first syllable,\nnecessitating a grave accent on the second; the\nsame remark applies to Nerei and Terei. Such has\nbeen the tradition as regards accents. Still I am well aware that certain learned men\nand some professed teachers of literature, to ensure\nthat certain words may be kept distinct, sometimes\nplace an acute accent on the last syllable, both when\nthey are teaching and in ordinary speech as, for\ninstance, in the following passage where they make the last syllable of circum acute on\nthe ground that, if that syllable were given the grave\naccent, it might be thought that they meant circus\nnot circuitus. Similarly when quale is interrogative,\nthey give the final syllable a grave accent, but when\nusing it in a comparison, make it acute. This practice,\nhowever, they restrict almost entirely to adverbs\nand pronouns; in other cases they follow the old\nusage. Personally I think that in such phrases\nas these the circumstances are almost entirely altered\nby the fact that we join two words together. For\nwhen I say circum litora I pronounce the phrase as\none word, concealing the fact that it is composed of\ntwo, consequently it contains but one acute accent,\nas though it were a single word. The same thing\noccurs in the phrase Troiae qui primus ab oris. It\nsometimes happens that the accent is altered by\nthe metre as in pecudes pictaeque volucres; for I shall\nread volucres with the acute on the middle syllable,\nbecause, although that syllable is short by nature, it\nis long by position else the last two syllables\nwould form an iambus, which its position in the\nhexameter does not allow. But these same words,\nif separated, will form no exception to the rule or\nif the custom under discussion prevails, the old law of the language will disappear. This law is more\ndifficult for the Greeks to observe, because they\nhave several dialects, as they call them, and what is\nwrong in one may be right in another. But with us\nthe rule is simplicity itself. For in every word\nthe acute accent is restricted to three syllables,\nwhether these be the only syllables in the word or\nthe three last, and will fall either on the penultimate\nor the antepenultimate. The middle of the three\nsyllables of which I speak will be acute or circumflexed, if long, while if it be short, it will have a\ngrave accent and the acute will be thrown back to\nthe preceding syllable, that is to say the antepenultimate. Every word has an acute accent, but\nnever more than one. Further the acute never falls\non the last syllable and therefore in dissyllabic words\nmarks the first syllable. Moreover the acute accent\nand the circumflex are never found in one and the\nsame word, since the circumflex itself contains an\nacute accent. Neither the circumflex nor the acute,\ntherefore, will ever be found in the last syllable of\na Latin word, with this exception, that monosyllables\nmust either be acute or circumflexed; otherwise we\nshould find words without an acute accent at all. There are also faults of sound, which we cannot reproduce in writing, as they spring from defects of the\nvoice and tongue. The Greeks who are happier in\ninventing names than we are call them iotacisms,\nlambdacisms, attenuations and broadenings; they also use the term when the voice seems to proceed from the depths of\nthe mouth. There are also certain peculiar and\nindescribable sounds for which we sometimes take\nwhole nations to fault. To sum up then, if all the\nfaults of which we have just spoken be avoided, we shall be in possession of the Greek that is to say, an exact and pleasing articulation; for\nthat is what we mean when we speak of correct\npronunciation. All other faults in speaking are concerned with\nmore words than one; among this class of faults is\nthe solecism, although there have been controversies\nabout this as well. For even those who acknowledge\nthat it occurs in connected speech, argue that, since\nit can be corrected by the alteration of one word,\nthe fault lies in the word and not in the phrase or\nsentence. For example whether amarae corticis or\nmedio cortice contains a solecism in gender and\npersonally I object to neither, as Vergil is the\nauthor of both; however, for the sake of argument\nlet us assume that one of the two is incorrect, still\nwhichever phrase is incorrect, it can be set right by\nthe alteration of the word in which the fault lies\nthat is to say we can emend either to amari corticis\nor media cortice. But it is obvious that these critics\nmisrepresent the case. For neither word is faulty\nin itself; the error arises from its association with\nanother word. The fault therefore lies in the\nphrase. Those who raise the question as to whether\na solecism can arise in a single word show greater\nintelligence. Is it for instance a solecism if a man\nwhen calling a single person to him says uenite,\nor in dismissing several persons says abi or discede\nOr again if the answer does not correspond to the\nquestion suppose, for example, when someone said\nto you , you were to reply Some too think it a solecism if the spoken word is\ncontradicted by the motion of hand or head. I do\nnot entirely concur with this view nor yet do I wholly dissent. I admit that a solecism may occur\nin a single word, but with this proviso there must\nbe something else equivalent to another word, to\nwhich the word, in which the error lies, can be\nreferred, so that the solecism arises from the faulty\nconnexion of those symbols by which facts are expressed and purpose indicated. To avoid all suspicion of quibbling, I will say that a solecism may\noccur in one word, but never in a word in isolation.\nThere is, however, some controversy as to the\nnumber and nature of the different kinds of solecism.\nThose who have dealt with the subject most fully\nmake a fourfold division, identical with that which\nis made in the case of barbarisms solecisms are\nbrought about by addition, for instance in phrases\nsuch as nam enim, de susum, in Alexandriam; by\nomission, in phrases such as ambulo viam, Aegypto\nvenio, or ne hoc fecit and by transposition as in\nquoque ego, enim hoc voluit, aulem non habuit. Under\nthis last head comes the question whether igitur can\nbe placed first in a sentence for I note that authors\nof the first rank disagree on this point, some of\nthem frequently placing it in that position, others\nnever. Some distinguish these three classes of\nerror from the solecism, styling addition a pleonasm,\nomission an ellipse, and transposition anastrophe and\nthey assert that if anastrophe is a solecism, hyperbaton\nmight also be so called. About substitution, that is\nwhen one word is used instead of another, there is\nno dispute. It is an error which we may detect in\nconnexion with all the parts of speech, but most\nfrequently in the verb, because it has greater variety than any other consequently in connexion with the\nverb we get solecisms of gender, tense, person and\nmood or or if you prefer either\nof these terms, be these types of error six in number,\nas some assert, or eight as is insisted by others for\nthe number of the forms of solecism will depend on\nthe number of subdivisions which you assign to the\nparts of speech of which we have just spoken.\nFurther there are solecisms of number; now Latin\nhas two numbers, singular and plural, while Greek\npossesses a third, namely the dual. There have\nhowever been some who have given us a dual as\nwell in words such as scripsere and legere, in which\nas a matter of fact the final syllable has been\nsoftened to avoid harshness, just as in old writers\nwe find male merere for male mereris. Consequently\nwhat they assert to be a dual is concerned solely\nwith this one class of termination, whereas in Greek\nit is found throughout the whole structure of the\nverb and in nouns as well, though even then it is\nbut rarely used. But we find not a trace of such a\nusage in any Latin author. On the contrary phrases\nsuch as devenere locos, conticuere omnes and\nconsedere duces clearly prove that they have nothing to do with the dual. Moreover dixere, although Antonius Rufus cites it as proof to the\ncontrary, is often used by the usher in the courts to\ndenote more than two advocates. Again, does not\nLivy near the beginning of his first book write\ntenuere arcem Sabini and later in adversum Romani\nsubiere But I can produce still better authority.\nFor Cicero in his Orator says, Similarly in vocables and\nnouns solecisms occur in connexion with gender,\nnumber and more especially case, by substitution\nof one for another. To these may be added\nsolecisms in the use of comparatives and superlatives,\nor the employment of patronymics instead of\npossessives and vice versa. As for solecisms connected\nwith expressions of quantity, there are some who\nwill regard phrases such as magnum peculiolum as a\nsolecism, because the diminutive is used instead of\nthe ordinary noun, which implies no diminution. I\nthink I should call it a misuse of the diminutive rather\nthan a solecism; for it is an error of sense, whereas\nsolecisms are not errors of sense, but rather faulty\ncombinations of words. As regards participles,\nsolecisms occur in case and gender as with nouns, in\ntense as with verbs, and in number as in both.\nThe pronoun admits of solecisms in gender, number\nand case. Solecisms also occur with great frequency in connexion with parts of speech but\na bare statement on this point is not sufficient,\nas it may lead a boy to think that such error\nconsists only in the substitution of one part of\nspeech for another, as for instance if a verb is\nplaced where we require a noun, or an adverb takes\nthe place of a pronoun and so on. For there are\nsome nouns which are cognate, that is to say of the\nsame genus, and he who uses the wrong species in\nconnexion with one of these will be guilty of the\nsame offence as if he were to change the genus.\nThus an and aut are conjunctions, but it would be\nbad Latin to say in a question hic and ille sit; ne and non are adverbs but he who says non feceris in lieu\nof ne feceris, is guilty of a similar mistake, since one\nnegative denies, while the other forbids. Further\nintro and intus are adverbs of place, but eo intus and\nintro sum are solecisms. Similar errors may be\ncommitted in connexion with the various kinds of\npronouns, interjections and prepositions. It is also\na solecism if there is a disagreement between what\nprecedes and what follows within the limits of a\nsingle clause. Some phrases have all the appearance\nof a solecism and yet cannot be called faulty; take\nfor instance phrases such as tragoedia Thyestes or\nludi Floralia and Megalensia although these are\nnever found in later times, they are the rule in\nancient writers. We will therefore style them figures\nand, though their use is more frequent in poets, will\nnot deny their employment even to orators. Figures\nhowever will generally have some justification,\nas I shall show in a later portion of this work, which\nI promised you a little while back. I must however point out that a figure, if used unwittingly,\nwill be a solecism. In the same class, though they\ncannot be called figures, come errors such as the use\nof masculine names with a female termination and\nfeminine names with a neuter termination. I have\nsaid enough about solecisms; for I did not set out to\nwrite a treatise on grammar, but was unwilling to\nslight the science by passing it by without salutation,\nwhen it met me in the course of my journey. I therefore resume the path which I prescribed\nfor myself and point out that words are either native or foreign. Foreign words, like our population\nand our institutions, have come to us from practically\nevery nation upon earth. I pass by words of Tuscan,\nSabine and Praenestine origin; for though Lucilius\nattacks Vettius for using them, and Pollio reproves\nLivy for his lapses into the dialect of Padua, I may be\nallowed to regard all such words as of native origin.\nMany Gallic words have become current coin, such\nas raeda chariot and petorritim four-wheeled\nwagon of which Cicero uses the former and Horace\nthe latter. Mappa napkin again, a word familiar\nin connexion with the circus, is claimed by the\nCarthaginians, while I have heard that gurdus, which\nis colloquially used in the sense of is\nderived from Spain. But this distinction between\nnative and foreign words has reference chiefly to\nGreek. For Latin is largely derived from that\nlanguage, and we use words which are admittedly\nGreek to express things for which we have no Latin\nequivalent. Similiarly they at tines borrow words\nfrom us. In this connexion the problem arises\nwhether foreign words should be declined according\nto their language or our own. If you come across\nan archaistic grammarian, he will insist on absolute\nconformity to Latin practice, because, since we have\nan ablative and the Greeks have not, it would be\nabsurd in declining a word to use five Greek\ncases and one Latin. He will also praise the\npatriotism of those who aimed at strengthening the\nLatin language and asserted that we had no need\nof foreign practices. They, therefore, pronounced\nCastorem with the second syllable long to bring it\ninto conformity with all those Latin nouns which\nhave the same termination in the nominative as Castor. They also insisted on the forms Palaemo,\nTelamo, and Plato the last being adopted by Cicero,\nbecause they could not find any Latin nouns ending\nin -on. They were reluctant even to permit\nmasculine Greek nouns to end in -as in the nominative case, and consequently in Caelius we find Pelia\ncincinnatus and in Messala bene fecit Euthia, and in\nCicero Hermagora. So we need not be surprised\nthat the majority of early writers said Aenea and\nAnchisa. For, it was urged, if such words are spelt\nlike Maecenas, Sufenas and Asprenas, the genitive\nshould terminate in -is not in -e. On the same\nprinciple they placed an acute accent on the middle\nsyllable of Olympus and tyrannus, because Latin does\nnot allow an acute accent on the first syllable if it is\nshort and is followed by two long syllables. So too\nwe get the Latinised genitives Ulixi and Achilli together with many other analogous forms. More recent\nscholars have instituted the practice of giving Greek\nnouns their Greek declension, although this is not\nalways possible. Personally I prefer to follow the\nLatin method, so far as grace of diction will permit.\nFor I should not like to say Calypsonem on the analogy\nof Iunonem, although Gaius Caesar in deference to\nantiquity does adopt this way of declining it. Current\npractice has however prevailed over his authority. In\nother words which can be declined in either way\nwithout impropriety, those who prefer it can employ\nthe Greek form they will not be speaking Latin,\nbut will not on the other hand deserve censure. Simple words are what they are in the nominative, that is, their essential nature. Compound words are formed by the prefix of a preposition as\nin innocens, though care must be taken that two\nconflicting prepositions are not prefixed as in\nimperterritus if this be avoided they may in certain\ncases have a double prefix as in incompositus or\nreconditus or the Ciceronian subabsurdtim. They may\nalso be formed by what I might term the combination of two independent units, as in maleficus. For I will not admit that the combination of three\nis possible at any rate in Latin, although Cicero\nasserts that capsis is compounded of cape si vis, and\nthere are to be found scholars who contend that\nLupercalia likewise is a compound of three parts of\nspeech, namely luere per caprum. As for Solitaurilia\nit is by now universally believed to stand for\nSuovelaurilia, a derivation which corresponds to the\nactual sacrifice, which has its counterpart in Homer\nas well. But these compounds are formed not so\nmuch from three words as from the fragments of\nthree. On the other hand Pacuvius seems to have\nformed compounds of a preposition and two vocables\ni.e. nouns as in the effect is unpleasing. Compounds are however\nformed from two complete Latin words, as for instance supefui and subterfui; though in this case\nthere is some question as to whether the words from\nwhich they are formed are complete. They may\nalso be formed of one complete and one incomplete word, as in the case of malevolus, or of one incomplete and one complete, such as noctivagus, or of\ntwo incomplete words as in pedisecus footman, or\nfrom one Latin and one foreign word as in biclinium\na dining-couch for two, or in the reverse order\nas in epitogium an upper garment or Anticato, and\nsometimes even from two foreign words as in\nepiraedium a thong attaching the horse to the raeda.\nFor in this last case the preposition is Greek, while\nraeda is Gallic, while the compound is employed\nneither by Greek nor Gaul, but has been appropriated by Rome from the two foreign tongues. In\nthe case of prepositions they are frequently changed\nby the act of compounding as a result we get\nabstulit, aufugit, amisit, though the preposition is ab,\nand coil, though the preposition is con. The same is\ntrue of ignauus and erepublica. But compounds are\nbetter suited to Greek than to Latin, though I do\nnot think that this is due to the nature of our\nlanguage the reason rather is that we have a\npreference for foreign goods, and therefore receive with applause, whereas we can scarce\ndefend incurvicervicus from derisive laughter. Words are proper when they bear their original\nmeaning; metaphorical, when they are used in a\nsense different from their natural meaning. Current\nwords are safest to use there is a spice of danger in\ncoining new. For if they are adopted, our style\nwins but small glory from them; while if they are\nrejected, they become a subject for jest. Still we\nmust make the venture; for as Cicero says, use\nsoftens even these words which at first seemed harsh.\nOn the other hand the power of onomatopoeia is denied\nus. Who would tolerate an attempt to imitate phrases like the much praised and  We should even feel some qualms about\nusing balare and hinntre, if\nwe had not the sanction of antiquity to support us. There are special rules which must be observed both by speakers and writers. Language is\nbased on reason, antiquity, authority and usage.\nReason finds its chief support in analogy and sometimes in etymology. As for antiquity, it is commended to us by the possession of a certain majesty, I\nmight almost say sanctity. Authority as a rule we\nderive from orators and historians. For poets, owing\nto the necessities of metre, are allowed a certain\nlicence except in cases where they deliberately\nchoose one of two expressions, when both are metrically possible, as for instance in imo de stirpe recisum\nand aeriae quo congessere palumbes or silice in nuda and the like. The judgment of a supreme orator\nis placed on the same level as reason, and even error\nbrings no disgrace, if it result from treading in the\nfootsteps of such distinguished guides. Usage\nhowever is the surest pilot in speaking, and we\nshould treat language as currency minted with\nthe public stamp. But in all these cases we have\nneed of a critical judgment, especially as regards\nanalogy a Greek term for which a Latin equivalent\nhas been found in proportion. The essence of analogy\nis the testing of all subjects of doubt by the application of some standard of comparison about which\nthere is no question, the proof that is to say of the\nuncertain by reference to the certain. This can be\ndone in two different ways by comparing similar\nwords, paying special attention to their final syllables hence monosyllables are asserted to lie outside the\ndomain of analogy and by the study of diminutives. Comparison of nouns will reveal either their gender\nor their declension in the first case, supposing the\nquestion is raised as to whether junis be masculine\nor feminine, panis will supply a standard of comparison in the second case, supposing we are in doubt\nas to whether we should say hac domu or hac domo,\ndomuum or domorum, the standard of comparison will\nbe found in words such as anus or manus. Diminutives\nmerely reveal the gender for instance, to return to\na word previously used as an illustration, funiculus\nproves thatfunis is masculine. The same standard\nmay be applied in the case of verbs. For instance\nif it should be asserted that the middle syllable of\nfervere is short, we can prove this to be an error,\nbecause all verbs which in the indicative terminate\nin -eo, make the middle syllable of the infinitive\nlong, if that syllable contain an e take as examples\nsuch verbs as prandeo, pendeo, spondeo with infinitives\nprandre, pendre, spondre. Those verbs, however,\nwhich terminate in -o alone, if they form the infinitive in e, have the e short; compare lego, dico, curro,\nwith the infinitives, legre, dicre, currre. I admit\nthat in Lucilius we find But with all due respect to so learned a man, if he\nregards fervit as on the same footing as currit and\nlegit, we shall say fervo as we say lego and curro\nbut such a form has never yet come to my ears. But this is not a true comparison for fervit resembles servit, and on this analogy we should say\nfervire like servire. It is also possible in certain\ncases to discover the present indicative of a verb from\nthe study of its other tenses. I remember, for instance, refuting certain scholars who criticised me for\nusing the word pepigi for, although they admitted\nthat it had been used by some of the best authors,\nthey asserted that it was an irrational form because\nthe present indicative paciscor, being passive in\nform, made pactus sum as its perfect. I in addition\nto quoting the authority of orators and historians\nmaintained that I was also supported by analogy.\nFor when I found ni ita pacunt in the Twelve Tables,\nI noted that cadunt provided a parallel it was clear\ntherefore that the present indicative, though now\nobsolete, was paco on the analogy of cado, and it\nwas further obvious that we say pepigi for just the\nsame reason that we say cecidi. But we must\nremember that analogy cannot be universally applied,\nas it is often inconsistent with itself. It is true\nindeed that scholars have attempted to justify certain\napparent anomalies for example, when it is noted\nto what an extent lepus and lupus, which resemble\neach other closely in the nominative, differ in the\nplural and in the other cases, they reply that they\nare not true parallels, since lepus is epicene, while\nlupus is masculine, although Varro in the book in\nwhich he narrates the origins of Rome, writes lupus\nfemina, following the precedent of Ennius and\nFabius Pictor. The same scholars, however, when\nasked why aper became apri in the genitive, but pater\npatris, asserted that aper was an absolute, pater\na relative noun. Further since both words derive\nfrom the Greek, they took refuge in the fact that provides a parallel to patris and to apri. But how will they evade the difficulty\nthat feminine nouns whose nominative singular\nends in -us never make the genitive end in -ris,\nand yet the genitive of Venus is Veneris again\nnouns ending in -es have various genitive terminations, but never end in -ris, but yet we have\nno choice but to make the genitive of Ceres Cereris Again what of those words which, although identical in the form of the nominative or present indicative, develop the utmost variety in their inflections.\nThus from Alba we get both Albanus and Albensis,\nfrom volo both volui and volavi. Analogy itself\nadmits that verbs whose present indicative ends in\n-o have a great variety of perfect formations, as\nfor instance cado cecidi, spondeo spopondi, pingo pinxi,\nlego legi, pono posui, fiango fregi, laudo laudavi. For\nanalogy was not sent down from heaven at the\ncreation of mankind to frame the rules of language,\nbut was discovered after they began to speak and to\nnote the terminations of words used in speech. It\nis therefore based not on reason but on example,\nnor is it a law of language, but rather a practice\nwhich is observed, being in fact the offspring of\nusage. Some scholars, however, are so perverse and\nobstinate in their passion for analogy, that they say\naudaciter in preference to audacter, the form preferred\nby all orators, and emicavit for emicuit, and conire\nfor coire. We may permit them to say audivisse,\nscivisse, tribunale and faciliter, nor will we deprive\nthem of frugalis as an alternative for frugi for\nfrom what else can frugalitas be formed They may\nalso be allowed to point out that phrases such as\ncentum milia nummum and fidem deum involve a double solecism, since they change both case and\nnumber. Of course we were in blank ignorance\nof the fact and were not simply conforming to usage\nand the demands of elegance, as in the numerous\ncases, with which Cicero deals magnificently, as\nalways, in his Orator. Augustus again in his letters\nto Gaius Caesar corrects him for preferring calidus\nto caldus, not on the ground that the former is not\nLatin, but because it is unpleasing and as he himself\nputs it in Greek affected. Some hold\nthat this is just a question of or correctness\nof speech, a subject to which I am far from being\nindifferent. For what can be more necessary than\nthat we should speak correctly Nay, I even think\nthat, as far as possible, we should cling to correct\nforms and resist all tendencies to change. But to\nattempt to retain forms long obsolete and extinct\nis sheer impertinence and ostentatious pedantry. I would suggest that the ripe scholar, who says without the aspirate and with a long e for it comes\nfrom avre and uses calefacere and conservavisse in\npreference to the usual forms, should also add face,\ndice and the like to his vocabulary. His way is the\nright way. Who doubts it But there is an easier\nand more frequented path close by. There is,\nhowever, nothing which annoys me more than their\nhabit not merely of inferring the nominative from\nthe oblique cases, but of actually altering it. For\ninstance in ebur and robur, the forms regularly used\nboth in writing and speech by the best authors,\nthese gentlemen change their second syllable to o,\nbecause their genitives are roboris and eboris, and because sulpur and guttur keep the u in the genitive. So\ntoo femur and iecur give rise to similar controversy. Their proceedings are just as arbitrary as if they\nwere to substitute an o in the genitives of sulpur\nand guttur on the analogy of eboris and roboris.\nThus Antonius Gnipho while admitting robur, ebur\nand even marmur to be correct, would have their\nplurals to be ebura, robura and marnura. If they\nwould only pay attention to the affinities existing\nbetween letters, they would realize that robur makes\nits genitive roboris in precisely the same way that\nlimes, miles, iudex and uindex make their genitives\nmilitis, limitis, iudicis and uindicis, not to mention other\nwords to which I have already referred. Do not nouns\nwhich are similar in the nominative show, as I have\nalready observed, quite different terminations in the\noblique eases Compare uirgo and Iuno, lusus and\nfusus, caspis and puppis and a thousand others.\nAgain some nouns are not used in the plural, while\nothers are not used in the singular, some are indeclinable, while others, like Jupiter, in the oblique\ncases entirely abandon the form of the nominative. The same is true of verbs for instance fero disappears in the perfect and subsequent tenses. Nor\ndoes it matter greatly whether such forms are nonexistent or too harsh to use. For what is the genitive singular of progenies or the genitive plural of spes\nOr how will quire and ruere form a perfect passive or\npassive participles. Why should I mention other\nwords when it is even doubtful whether the genitive\nof senatus is senati or senatus In view of what I\nhave said, it seems to me that the remark, that it\nis one thing to speak Latin and another to speak\ngrammar, was far from unhappy. So much for\nanalogy, of which I have said more than enough. Etymology inquires into the origin of words, and was called notation by Cicero, on the ground that\nthe term used by Aristotle is which may\nbe translated by nota. A literal rendering of would be ueriloquium, a form which even Cicero, its\ninventor, shrinks from using. Some again, with an\neye to the meaning of the word, call it origination.\nEtymology is sometimes of the utmost use, whenever the word under discussion needs interpretation. For instance Marcus Caelius wishes to prove that he\nis homo frugi, not because he is abstemious for he\ncould not even pretend to be that, but because he\nis useful to many, that is fructuosus, from which\nfrugalitas is derived. Consequently we find room\nfor etymology when we are concerned with definitions. Sometimes again this science attempts to\ndistinguish between correct forms and barbarisms, as\nfor instance when we are discussing whether we\nshould call Sicily Triquetra or Triquedra, or say\nmeridies or medidies, not to mention other words\nwhich depend on current usage. Such a science\ndemands profound erudition, whether we are dealing with the large number of words which are\nderived from the Greek, more especially those\ninflected according to the practice of the Aeolic\ndialect, the form of Greek which most nearly\nresembles Latin; or are using ancient historians as\na basis for inquiry into the origin of names of men,\nplaces, nations and cities. For instance what is the\norigin of names such as Brutus, Publicola, or Pythicus\nWhy do we speak of Latium, Italia or Beneventum\nWhat is the reason for employing such names as\nCapitolium, collis Quirinalis or Argietum I now turn to minor points concerning which\nenthusiasts for etymology give themselves an infinity of trouble, restoring to their true form words\nwhich have become slightly altered the methods\nwhich they employ are varied and manifold they\nshorten them or lengthen them, add, remove, or\ninterchange letters and syllables as the case may be.\nAs a result perverseness of judgment leads to the\nmost hideous absurdities. I am ready to admit that\nconsul may be derived from consulere in the sense of\nconsulting or judging; for the ancients used consulere in the latter sense, and it still survives in the\nphrase rogat boni consulas, that is bonum iudices, Again senatus may well be derived from old\nage for the senators are called \nI concur in the derivations assigned to rex rector\nto say nothing of many other words where there\ncan be no doubt, and do not refuse to accept those\nsuggested for tegula, regula and the like let classis\nbe from calare call out, summon, lepus be a contraction of levipes and vulpes of volipes. But are we\nalso to admit the derivation of certain words from\ntheir opposites, and accept lucus a non lucendo, since\na grove is dark with shade, ludus in the sense of\nschool as being so called because it is quite the\nreverse of and Dis, Ditis from diues, because\nPluto is far from being rich Are we to assent to\nthe view that homo is derived from humus, because\nman sprang from the earth, as though all other\nliving things had not the same origin or as if\nprimitive man gave the earth a name before giving\none to himself Or again can verbum be derived\nfrom aer verheratus,  Let us go a\nlittle further and we shall find that stella is believed\nto be still luminis a derivation\nwhose author is so famous in literature that it would be unkind to mention his name in connexion with a\npoint where he comes in for censure. But those\nwho collected such derivations in book form, put\ntheir names on the title page; and Gavius thought\nhimself a perfect genius when he identified caelibes, with caelites, on the ground\nthat they are free from a heavy load of care, and\nsupported this opinion by a Greek analogy for he\nasserted that had a precisely\nsimilar origin. Modestus is not his inferior in\ninventive power for he asserts that caelibes, that is\nto say unmarried men, are so called because Saturn\ncut off the genital organs of Caelus. Aelius asserts\nthat pituita, is so called quia petat uitam,\nbecause it attacks life. But we may pardon anyone\nafter the example set by Varro. For he tried to\npersuade Cicero, to whom he dedicated his work,\nthat a field was called eager because something is\ndone in it agitur, and jackdaws graculos because\nthey fly in flocks gregatim, in spite of the obvious\nfact that the first word is derived from the Greek,\nthe latter from the cry of the bird in question. But Varro had such a passion for derivations that he\nderived the name merula from mera\nuolans on the ground that it flies alone Some\nscholars do not hesitate to have recourse to etymology\nfor the origin of every word, deriving names such as\nRufus or Longus from the appearance of their\npossessor, verbs such as strepere or murmurare from\nthe sounds which they represent, and even extending this practice to certain derivatives, making\nuelox for instance find its origin in uelocitas, as well\nas to compounds and the like now although such\nwords doubtless have an origin, no special science is required to detect it, since it is only doubtful cases\nthat demand the intervention of the etymologist. Archaic words not only enjoy the patronage of\ndistinguished authors, but also give style a certain\nmajesty and charm. For they have the authority of\nage behind them, and for the very reason that they\nhave fallen into desuetude, produce an attractive\neffect not unlike that of novelty. But such words\nmust be used sparingly and must not thrust themselves upon our notice, since there is nothing more\ntiresome than affectation, nor above all must they be\ndrawn from remote and forgotten ages I refer to\nwords such as topper, antegerio, exanclare, prosapia, and the language of the Salian Hymns now scarcely\nunderstood by its own priests. Religion, it is true,\nforbids us to alter the words of these hymns and\nwe must treat them as sacred things. But what a\nfaulty thing is speech, whose prime virtue is clearness, if it requires an interpreter to make its meaning\nplain Consequently in the case of old words the\nbest will be those that are newest, just as in the\ncase of new words the best will be the oldest. The same arguments apply to authority. For\nalthough the use of words transmitted to us by the\nbest authors may seem to preclude the possibility\nof error, it is important to notice not merely what\nthey said, but what words they succeeded in sanctioning. For no one to-day would introduce words such\nas tuburchinabunidus, or lurchinabundus, although they have the authority of\nCato; nor make lodices, masculine,\nthough Pollio preferred that gender; nor say gladiola, though Messala used this plural, nor parricidatus for parricide, a form which can\nscarcely be tolerated even in Caelius, nor will Calvus\npersuade me to speak of collos, Indeed,\nwere these authors alive to-day, they would never\nuse such words. Usage remains to be discussed. For it would be\nalmost laughable to prefer the language of the\npast to that of the present day, and what is ancient\nspeech but ancient usage of speaking But even\nhere the critical faculty is necessary, and we must\nmake up our minds what we mean by usage. If it\nbe defined merely as the practice of the majority,\nwe shall have a very dangerous rule affecting not\nmerely style but life as well, a far more serious\nmatter. For where is so much good to be found that\nwhat is right should please the majority The\npractices of depilation, of dressing the hair in\ntiers, or of drinking to excess at the baths, although\nthey may have thrust their way into society, cannot claim the support of usage, since there is something to blame in all of them although we have\nusage on our side when we bathe or have our\nhair cut or take our meals together. So too in\nspeech we must not accept as a rule of language\nwords and phrases that have become a vicious habit\nwith a number of persons. To say nothing of the\nlanguage of the uneducated, we are all of us well\naware that whole theatres and the entire crowd of\nspectators will often commit barbarisms in the cries\nwhich they utter as one man. I will therefore define\nusage in speech as the agreed practice of educated\nmen, just as where our way of life is concerned I\nshould define it as the agreed practice of all good\nmen. Having stated the rules which we must\nfollow in speaking, I will now proceed to lay down\nthe rules which must be observed when we write.\nSuch rules are called orthography by the Greeks; let\nus style it the science of writing correctly. This\nscience does not consist merely in the knowledge of\nthe letters composing each syllable such a study\nis beneath the dignity of a teacher of grammar,\nbut, in my opinion, develops all its subtlety in connexion with doubtful points. For instance, while it\nis absurd to place a circumflex over all long syllables\nsince the quantity of most syllables is obvious from\nthe very nature of the word which is written, it is\nall the same occasionally necessary, since the same\nletter involves a different meaning according as it is\nlong or short. For example we determine whether\nmains is to mean an or a by\nthe use of the circumflex; palus means a if\nthe first syllable is long, a if it be short;\nagain when the same letter is short in the nominative\nand long in the ablative, we generally require the\ncircumflex to make it clear which quantity to understand. Similarly it has been held that we should\nobserve distinctions such as the following if the\npreposition ex is compounded with specto, there will\nbe an s in the second syllable, while there will be no\ns if it is compounded with pecto. Again the following distinction has frequently been observed ad is\nspelt with a d when it is a preposition, but with a t\nwhen it is a conjunction, while cum is spelt quum\nwhen it denotes time, but cum when it denotes\naccompaniment. Still more pedantic are the practices\nof making the fourth letter of quidquid a c to avoid\nthe appearance of repeating a question, and of writing quotidie instead of colidie to show that it stands for\nquot diebus. But such practices have disappeared\ninto the limbo of absurdities. It is often debated whether in our spelling of\nprepositions we should be guided by their sound\nwhen compounded, or separate. For instance when\nI say optinuit, logic demands that the second\nletter should be a b, while to the ear the sound is\nrather that of p or again take the case of immunis the letter n, which is required by strict adherence to\nfact, is forced by the sound of the m. which follows\nto change into another m. We must also note when\nanalysing compound words, whether the middle\nconsonant adheres to the preceding syllable or to\nthat which follows. For example since the latter\npart of haruspex is from spectare, the s must be\nassigned to the third syllable. In abstemius on the\nother hand it will go with the first syllable since the\nword is derived from abstinentia temeti, As for k my view is that it should not\nbe used at all except in such words as may be indicated by the letter standing alone as an abbreviation.\nI mention the fact because some hold that k should\nbe used whenever the next letter is an a, despite\nthe existence of the letter c which maintains its\nforce in conjunction with all the vowels. Orthography, however, is also the servant of usage\nand therefore undergoes frequent change. I make\nno mention of the earliest times when our alphabet\ncontained fewer letters and their shapes differed\nfrom those which we now use, while their values also\nwere different. For instance in Greek the letter o\nwas sometimes long and short, as it is with us, and\nagain was sometimes used to express the syllable which is identical with its name. And in Latin\nancient writers ended a number of words with d, as\nmay be seen on the column adorned with the beaks\nof ships, which was set up in the forum in honour\nof Duilius. Sometimes again they gave words a\nfinal g, as we may still see in the shrine of the Sun,\nclose to the temple of Quirinus, where we find the\nword uesperug, which we write uesperugo evening\nstar. I have already spoken of the interchange\nof letters and need not repeat my remarks here\nperhaps their pronunciation corresponded with their\nspelling. For a long time the doubling of semivowels was avoided, while down to the time of\nAccius and beyond, long syllables were indicated by\nrepetition of the vowel. The practice of joining e\nand i as in the Greek diphthong lasted longer it\nserved to distinguish cases and numbers, for which\nwe may compare the instructions of Lucilius But this addition of e is quite superfluous, since t\ncan be long no less than short it is also at times\ninconvenient. For in those words which end in i\nand have e as their last letter but one, we shall on\nthis principle have to write e twice I refer to words\nsuch as aurei or argentei and the like. Now such a\npractice will be an actual hindrance to those who are\nlearning to read. This difficulty occurs in Greek as well in connexion with the addition of an iota, which\nis employed not merely in the termination of the\ndative, but is sometimes found in the middle of\nwords as in for the reason that the analysis\napplied by etymology shows the word to be a trisyllable and requires the addition of that letter.\nThe diphthong ae now written with an e, was pronounced in old days as ai; some wrote ai in all cases,\nas in Greek, others confined its use to the dative and\ngenitive singular; whence it comes that Vergil,\nalways a passionate lover of antiquity, inserted pictai\nuestis and aquai in his poems. But in the plural they\nused e and wrote Syllae, Galbae. Lucilius has given\ninstructions on this point also; his instructions\noccupy quite a number of verses, for which the\nincredulous may consult his ninth book. Again in\nCicero's days and a little later, it was the almost\nuniversal practice to write a double s, whenever that\nletter occurred between two long vowels or after a\nlong vowel, as for example in caussae, cassus, diuissiones.\nThat he and Vergil both used this spelling is shown\nby their own autograph manuscripts. And yet at\na slightly earlier date iussi which we write with a\ndouble s was spelt with only one. Further optimnus\nmaximus, which older writers spelt with a u, appear for the first time with an i such at any rate\nis the tradition in an inscription of Gaius Caesar. We now write here, but I still find in manuscripts of\nthe old comic poets phrases such as heri ad me uenit,\nand the same spelling is found in letters of Augustus\nwritten or corrected by his own hand. Again did\nnot Cato the censor spell dicam and faciam as dicem and faciem and observe the same practice in words of\nsimilar termination This is clear from old manuscripts of his works and is recorded by Messala in\nhis treatise on the letter s. Sibe and quase are found\nin many books, but I cannot say whether the\nauthors wished them to be spelt thus I learn from\nPedianus that Livy, whose precedent he himself\nadopted, used this spelling to-day we make these\nwords end with an i. What shall I say of uorlices,\nuorsus and the like, which Scipio Africanus is said\nto have been the first to spell with an e My own\nteachers spelt seruus and ceruus with a uo, in order\nthat the repetition of the vowel might not lead to\nthe coalescence and confusion of the two sounds\nto-day however we write these words with a double\nu on the principle which I have already stated\nneither spelling however exactly expresses the pronunciation. It was not without reason that Claudius\nintroduced the Aeolic digamma to represent this\nsound. It is a distinct improvement that to-day we\nspell cui as I have written it when I was a boy it\nused to be spelt quoi, giving it a very full sound,\nmerely to distinguish it from qui. Again, what of words whose spelling is at variance\nwith their pronunciation For instance C is used as\nan abbreviation for Gaius, and when inverted stands\nfor a woman, for as we know from the words of the\nmarriage service women used to be called Gaiae,\njust as men were called Gaii. Gnaeus too in the\nabbreviation indicating the praenomen is spelt in a\nmanner which does not agree with its pronunciation.\nWe also find columnas and consul spelt without an n, while Subura when indicated by three letters is spelt\nSuc. I could quote many other examples of this,\nbut I fear that I have already said too much on so\ntrivial a theme. On all such subjects the teacher must use his own\njudgment; for in such matters it should be the\nsupreme authority. For my own part, I think that,\nwithin the limits prescribed by usage, words should\nbe spelt as they are pronounced. For the use of\nletters is to preserve the sound of words and to\ndeliver them to readers as a sacred trust consequently they ought to represent the pronunciation\nwhich we are to use. These are the more important\npoints in connexion with writing and speaking\ncorrectly. I do not go so far as to deny to the\nteacher of literature all part in the two remaining departments of speaking and writing with\nelegance and significance, but I reserve these for a\nmore important portion of this work, as I have still\nto deal with the duties of the teacher of rhetoric. I am however haunted by the thought that some\nreaders will regard what I have said as trivial details\nwhich are only likely to prove a hindrance to those\nwho are intent upon a greater task; and I myself\ndo not think that we should go so far as to lose our\nsleep of nights or quibble like fools over such\nminutiae; for such studies make mincemeat of the\nmind. But it is only the superfluities of grammar\nthat do any harm. I ask you, is Cicero a less great\norator for having given this science his diligent\nattention or for having, as his letters show, demanded\nrigid correctness of speech from his son Or was the\nvigour of Gaius Caesar's eloquence impaired by the\npublication of a treatise on Analogy Or the polish of Messala dimmed by the fact that he devoted\nwhole books to the discussion not merely of\nsingle words, but of single letters Such studies do\nno harm to those who but pass through them it is\nonly the pedantic stickler who suffers. Reading remains for consideration. In\nthis connexion there is much that can only be\ntaught in actual practice, as for instance when the\nboy should take breath, at what point he should\nintroduce a pause into a line, where the sense ends\nor begins, when the voice should be raised or\nlowered, what modulation should be given to each\nphrase, and when he should increase or slacken\nspeed, or speak with greater or less energy. In\nthis portion of my work I will give but one golden\nrule to do all these things, he must understand\nwhat he reads. But above all his reading must be\nmanly, combining dignity and charm; it must be\ndifferent from the reading of prose, for poetry is\nsong and poets claim to be singers. But this fact\ndoes not justify degeneration into sing-song or the\neffeminate modulations now in vogue there is an\nexcellent saying on this point attributed to Gaius\nCaesar while he was still a boy Again I do not, like some teachers, wish character\nas revealed by speeches to be indicated as it is by\nthe comic actor, though I think that there should\nbe some modulation of the voice to distinguish such\npassages from those where the poet is speaking in\nperson. There are other points where there is much\nneed of instruction above all, unformed minds\nwhich are liable to be all the more deeply impressed\nby what they learn in their days of childish ignorance, must learn not merely what is eloquent;\nit is even more important that they should study\nwhat is morally excellent. It is therefore an admirable practice which now\nprevails, to begin by reading Homer and Vergil,\nalthough the intelligence needs to be further developed for the full appreciation of their merits but\nthere is plenty of time for that since the boy will\nread them more than once. In the meantime let his\nmind be lifted by the sublimity of heroic verse,\ninspired by the greatness of its theme and imbued\nwith the loftiest sentiments. The reading of tragedy\nalso is useful, and lyric poets will provide nourishment for the mind, provided not merely the authors\nbe carefully selected, but also the passages from\ntheir works which are to be read. For the Greek lyric\npoets are often licentious and even in Horace there\nare passages which I should be unwilling to explain\nto a class. Elegiacs, however, more especially erotic\nelegy, and hendecasyllables, which are merely sections\nof Sotadean verse concerning which latter I need\ngive no admonitions, should be entirely banished, if\npossible; if not absolutely banished, they should be\nreserved for pupils of a less impressionable age. As to\ncomedy, whose contribution to eloquence may be of\nno small importance, since it is concerned with every\nkind of character and emotion, I will shortly point\nout in its due places what use can in my opinion\nbe made of it in the education of boys. As soon as\nwe have no fear of contaminating their morals, it\nshould take its place among the subjects which it is\nspecially desirable to read. I speak of Menander,\nthough I would not exclude others. For Latin\nauthors will also be of some service. But the subjects selected for lectures to boys should be those\nwhich will enlarge the mind and provide the greatest nourishment to the intellect. Life is quite long\nenough for the subsequent study of those other subjects which are concerned with matters of interest\nsolely to learned men. But even the old Latin poets\nmay be of great value, in spite of the fact that their\nstrength lies in their natural talent rather than in\ntheir art above all they will contribute richness\nof vocabulary for the vocabulary of the tragedians\nis full of dignity, while in that of the comedians\nthere is a certain elegance and Attic grace. They\nare, too, more careful about dramatic structure than\nthe majority of moderns, who regard epigram as the\nsole merit of every kind of literary work. For\npurity at any rate and manliness, if I may say so,\nwe must certainly go to these writers, since to-day\neven our style of speaking is infected with all the\nfaults of modern decadence. Finally we may derive\nconfidence from the practice of the greatest orators\nof drawing upon the early poets to support their\narguments or adorn their eloquence. For we find,\nmore especially in the pages of Cicero, but frequently in Asinius and other orators of that period, quotations from Ennius, Accius, Pacuvius, Lucilius, Terence,\nCaecilius and others, inserted not merely to show\nthe speaker's learning, but to please his hearers\nas well, since the charms of poetry provide a pleasant relief from the severity of forensic eloquence. Such quotations have the additional advantage of\nhelping the speaker's case, for the orator makes use\nof the sentiments expressed by the poet as evidence\nin support of his own statements. But while my\nearlier remarks have special application to the\neducation of boys, those which I have just made apply rather to persons of riper years; for the love of\nletters and the value of reading are not confined to\none's schooldays, but end only with life. In lecturing the teacher of literature must give\nattention to minor points as well he will ask his\nclass after analysing a verse to give him the parts of\nspeech and the peculiar features of the feet which\nit contains these latter should be so familiar in\npoetry as to make their presence desired even in\nthe prose of oratory. He will point out what words\nare barbarous, what improperly used, and what are\ncontrary to the laws of language. He will not do\nthis by way of censuring the poets for such peculiarities, for poets are usually the servants of their\nmetres and are allowed such licence that faults\nare given other names when they occur in poetry\nfor we style them metaplasms, schematisms and\nschemata, as I have said, and make a virtue of\nnecessity. Their aim will rather be to familiarise the\npupil with the artifices of style and to stimulate his\nmemory. Further in the elementary stages of such\ninstruction it will not be unprofitable to show the\ndifferent meanings which may be given to each word.\nWith regard to glossemala, that is to say words not\nin common use, the teacher must exercise no ordinary diligence, while still greater care is required in\nteaching all the tropes which are employed for the\nadornment more especially of poetry, but of oratory\nas well, and in making his class acquainted with the\ntwo sorts of schemata or figures known as figures of\nspeech and figures of thought. I shall however postpone discussion of tropes and figures till I come to\ndeal with the various ornaments of style. Above\nall he will impress upon their minds the value of\nproper arrangement, and of graceful treatment of\nthe matter in hand he will show what is appropriate\nto the various characters, what is praiseworthy in the\nthoughts or words, where copious diction is to be\ncommended and where restraint. In addition to this he will explain the various\nstories that occur this must be done with care,\nbut should not be encumbered with superfluous\ndetail. For it is sufficient to set forth the version\nwhich is generally received or at any rate rests upon\ngood authority. But to ferret out everything that\nhas ever been said on the subject even by the most\nworthless of writers is a sign of tiresome pedantry\nor empty ostentation, and results in delaying and\nswamping the mind when it would be better\nemployed on other themes. The man who pores\nover every page even though it be wholly unworthy\nof reading, is capable of devoting his attention\nto the investigation of old wives' tales. And yet\nthe commentaries of teachers of literature are full\nof such encumbrances to learning and strangely\nunfamiliar to their own authors. It is, for instance,\nrecorded that Didymus, who was unsurpassed for\nthe number of books which he wrote, on one occasion\nobjected to some story as being absurd, whereupon\none of his own books was produced which contained\nthe story in question. Such abuses occur chiefly in\nconnexion with fabulous stories and are sometimes\ncarried to ludicrous or even scandalous extremes\nfor in such cases the more unscrupulous commentator\nhas such full scope for invention, that he can tell lies to his heart's content about whole books and authors\nwithout fear of detection for what never existed\ncan obviously never be found, whereas if the subject\nis familiar the careful investigator will often detect\nthe fraud. Consequently I shall count it a merit in\na teacher of literature that there should be some\nthings which he does not know. IX. I have now finished with two of the\ndepartments, with which teachers of literature profess to deal, namely the art of speaking correctly\nand the interpretation of authors; the former they\ncall nethodic, the latter histori We must however\nadd to their activities instruction in certain rudiments\nof oratory for the benefit of those who are not yet\nripe for the schools of rhetoric. Their pupils should\nlearn to paraphrase Aesop's fables, the natural successors of the fairy stories of the nursery, in simple\nand restrained language and subsequently to set\ndown this paraphrase in writing with the same simplicity of style they should begin by analysing\neach verse, then give its meaning in different\nlanguage, and finally proceed to a freer paraphrase in\nwhich they will be permitted now to abridge and\nnow to embellish the original, so far as this may be\ndone without losing the poet's meaning. This is no\neasy task even for the expert instructor, and the\npupil who handles it successfully will be capable of\nlearning everything. He should also be set to write\naphorisms, moral essays chriae and delineations of character ethologiae, of which the teacher will first give\nthe general scheme, since such themes will be drawn\nfrom their reading. In all of these exercises the\ngeneral idea is the same, but the form differs\naphorisms are general propositions, while ethologiae are concerned with persons . Of moral essays there\nare various forms some are akin to aphorisms and\ncommence with a simple statement or  others give the answer to a question\nand begin or while a third and not dissimilar type\nbegins, Some hold that a moral essay may take some action\nas its text; take for example the statement or\na very similar example which they do not venture\nactually to propose as a theme for a moral essay, but\ncontent themselves with saying that it is of the\nnature of such a theme, namely All\nthese instances are couched in the same grammatical form and deeds no less than sayings may\nbe presented for treatment. Short stories from the\npoets should in my opinion be handled not with\na view to style but as a means of increasing knowledge. Other more serious and ambitious tasks\nhave been also imposed on teachers of literature by\nthe fact that Latin rhetoricians will have nothing to\ndo with them Greek rhetoricians have a better\ncomprehension of the extent and nature of the tasks\nplaced on their shoulders. THE custom has prevailed and is daily growing\ncommoner of sending boys to the schools of rhetoric\nmuch later than is reasonable this is always the\ncase as regards Latin rhetoric and occasionally\napplies to Greek as well. The reason for this is\ntwofold the rhetoricians, more especially our own,\nhave abandoned certain of their duties and the\nteachers of literature have undertaken tasks which\nrightly belong to others. For the rhetorician considers that his duty is merely to declaim and give\ninstruction in the theory and practice of declamation\nand confines his activities to deliberative and judicial\nthemes, regarding all others as beneath the dignity\nof his profession; while the teacher of literature is\nnot satisfied to take what is left him and we owe\nhim a debt of gratitude for this, but even presumes\nto handle declamations in character and deliberative\nthemes, tasks which impose the very heaviest burden\non the speaker. Consequently subjects which once\nformed the first stages of rhetoric have come to\nform the final stages of a literary education, and\nboys who are ripe for more advanced study are kept\nback in the inferior school and practise rhetoric\nunder the direction of teachers of literature. Thus\nwe get the absurd result that a boy is not regarded\nas fit to go on to the schools of declamation till he\nknows how to declaim. The two professions must each be assigned their\nproper sphere. Grammatice, which we translate as\nthe science of letters, must learn to know its own\nlimits, especially as it has encroached so far beyond\nthe boundaries to which its unpretentious name\nshould restrict it and to which its earlier professors\nactually confined themselves. Springing from a tiny\nfountain-head, it has gathered strength from the\nhistorians and critics and has swollen to the dimensions of a brimming river, since, not content with the\ntheory of correct speech, no inconsiderable subject,\nit has usurped the study of practically all the highest\ndepartments of knowledge. On the other hand\nrhetoric, which derives its name from the power of\neloquence, must not shirk its peculiar duties nor rejoice to see its own burdens shouldered by others.\nFor the neglect of these is little less than a surrender\nof its birthright. I will of course admit that there\nmay be a few professors of literature who have\nacquired sufficient knowledge to be able to teach rhetoric as well; but when they do so, they are performing the duties of the rhetorician, not their own. A further point into which we must enquire concerns the age at which a boy may be considered\nsufficiently advanced to profit by the instructions of\nthe rhetorician. In this connexion we must consider\nnot the boy's actual age, but the progress he has\nmade in his studies. To put it briefly, I hold that\nthe best answer to the question is this, But this question is really dependent on that previously raised. For if the duties of\nthe teacher of literature are prolonged to include\ninstruction in deliberative declamation, this will postpone the need for the rhetorician. On the other\nhand if the rhetorician does not refuse to undertake\nthe first duties of his task, his instruction will be required from the moment the boy begins to compose\nnarratives and his first attempts at passages of praise\nor denunciation. We know that the orators of\nearlier days improved their eloquence by declaiming\nthemes and common-places and other forms of\nrhetorical exercises not involving particular circumstances or persons such as provide the material for\nreal or imaginary causes. From this we can clearly\nsee what a scandalous dereliction of duty it is for\nthe schools of rhetoric to abandon this department\nof their work, which was not merely its first, but\nfor a long time its sole task. What is there in\nthose exercises of which I have just spoken that\ndoes not involve matters which are the special concern of rhetoric and further are typical of actual\nlegal cases Have we not to narrate facts in\nthe law-courts Indeed I am not sure that this is\nnot the most important department of rhetoric in\nactual practice. Are not eulogy and denunciation\nfrequently introduced in the course of the contests\nof the courts Are not common-places frequently\ninserted in the very heart of lawsuits, whether, like\nthose which we find in the works of Cicero, they are\ndirected against vice, or, like those published by\nQuintus Hortensius, deal with questions of general\ninterest such as or are employed to\ndefend or impugn the credibility of witnesses These are weapons which we should always have\nstored in our armoury ready for immediate use as\noccasion may demand. The critic who denies that such matters concern an orator is one who will\nrefuse to believe that a statue is being begun\nwhen its limbs are actually being cast. Some will\nthink that I am in too great a hurry, but let no one\naccuse me of thinking that the pupil who has been\nentrusted to the rhetorician should forthwith be\nwithdrawn from the teacher of literature. The latter\nwill still have certain hours allotted him, and there\nis no reason to fear that a boy will be overloaded by\nreceiving instruction from two different masters. It\nwill not mean any increase of work, but merely the\ndivision among two masters of the studies which\nwere previously indiscriminately combined under one\nand the efficiency of either teacher will be increased.\nThis method is still in vogue among the Greeks, but\nhas been abandoned by us, not perhaps without some\nexcuse, as there were others ready to step into the\nrhetorician's shoes. II. As soon therefore as a boy has made sufficient\nprogress in his studies to be able to follow what I\nhave styled the first stage of instruction in rhetoric,\nhe should be placed under a rhetorician. Our first\ntask must be to enquire whether the teacher is of\ngood character. The reason which leads me to deal\nwith this subject in this portion of my work is not\nthat I regard character as a matter of indifference\nwhere other teachers are concerned, I have already\nshown how important I think it in the preceding\nbook, but that the age to which the pupil has now\nattained makes the mention of this point especially\nnecessary. For as a rule boys are on the verge of\nmanhood when transferred to the teacher of rhetoric\nand continue with him even when they are young\nmen consequently we must spare no effort to secure that the purity of the teacher's character should\npreserve those of tenderer years from corruption,\nwhile its authority should keep the bolder spirits\nfrom breaking out into licence. Nor is it sufficient\nthat he should merely set an example of the highest\npersonal self-control; he must also be able to govern\nthe behaviour of his pupils by the strictness of his\ndiscipline. Let him therefore adopt a parental attitude to his\npupils, and regard himself as the representative of\nthose who have committed their children to his\ncharge. Let him be free from vice himself and\nrefuse to tolerate it in others. Let him be strict but\nnot austere, genial but not too familiar for austerity\nwill make him unpopular, while familiarity breeds\ncontempt. Let his discourse continually turn on what\nis good and honourable; the more he admonishes,\nthe less he will have to punish. He must control\nhis temper without however shutting his eyes to\nfaults requiring correction his instruction must be\nfree from affectation, his industry great, his demands\non his class continuous, but not extravagant. He\nmust be ready to answer questions and to put\nthem unasked to those who sit silent. In praising\nthe recitations of his pupils he must be neither\ngrudging nor over-generous the former quality will\ngive them a distaste for work, while the latter will\nproduce a complacent self-satisfaction. In correcting\nfaults he must avoid sarcasm and above all abuse\nfor teachers whose rebukes seem to imply positive\ndislike discourage industry. He should declaim\ndaily himself and, what is more, without stint, that\nhis class may take his utterances home with them.\nFor however many models for imitation he may give them from the authors they are reading, it will\nstill be found that fuller nourishment is provided by\nthe living voice, as we call it, more especially when\nit proceeds from the teacher himself, who, if his\npupils are rightly instructed, should be the object\nof their affection and respect. And it is scarcely\npossible to say how much more readily we imitate\nthose whom we like. I strongly disapprove of the prevailing practice of\nallowing boys to stand up or leap from the seats in\nthe expression of their applause. Young men, even\nwhen they are listening to others, should be\ntemperate in manifesting their approval. If this\nbe insisted upon, the pupil will depend on his\ninstructor's verdict and will take his approval as\na guarantee that he has spoken well. The worst\nform of politeness, as it has come to be called, is\nthat of mutual and indiscriminate applause, a practice\nwhich is unseemly, theatrical and unworthy of a\ndecently disciplined school, in addition to being the\nworst foe to genuine study. For if every effusion is\ngreeted with a storm of ready-made applause, care\nand industry come to be regarded as superfluous. The audience no less than the speaker should therefore keep their eyes fixed on their teacher's face, since\nthus they will learn to distinguish between what is\npraiseworthy and what is not for just as writing\ngives facility, so listening begets the critical\nfaculty. But in the schools of to-day we see boys\nstooping forward ready to spring to their feet at\nthe close of each period they not merely rise, but\nrush forward with shouts of unseemly enthusiasm.\nSuch compliments are mutual and the success of a\ndeclamation consists in this kind of applause. The result is vanity and empty self-sufficiency, carried to\nsuch an extent that, intoxicated by the wild enthusiasm of their fellow-pupils, they conceive a spite\nagainst their master, if his praise does not come up\nto their expectation. But teachers must also insist\non receiving an attentive and quiet hearing from the\nclass when they themselves declaim. For the\nmaster should not speak to suit his pupil's standard,\nbut they should speak to suit his. Further he should,\nif possible, keep his eyes open to note the points\nwhich each boy praises and observe the manner in\nwhich he expresses his approval, and should rejoice\nthat his words give pleasure not only for his own\nsake, but for that of those who show sound judgment in their appreciation. I do not approve of boys sitting mixed with young\nmen. For even if the teacher be such an one as we\nshould desire to see in charge of the morals and\nstudies of the young, and can keep his youthful\npupils under proper control, it is none the less\ndesirable to keep the weaker members separate from\nthe more mature, and to avoid not only the actual\ncharge of corruption but the merest suspicion of it. I have thought it worth while to put my views on\nthis subject quite briefly. For I do not think it\nnecessary even to warn the teacher that both he and\nhis school must be free from the grosser vices. And\nshould there be any father who does not trouble to\nchoose a teacher for his son who is free from the\nobvious taint of immorality, he may rest assured\nthat all the other precepts, which I am attempting\nto lay down for the benefit of our youth, will be\nabsolutely useless to him, if he neglects this. III. I do not think that I should pass by in silence even the opinion of those who, even when they\nregard boys as ripe for the rhetorician, still do not\nthink that they should at once be placed under the\nmost eminent teacher available, but prefer to keep\nthem for a while under inferior masters, on the\nground that in the elementary stages a mediocre\ninstructor is easier to understand and to imitate, and\nless reluctant to undertake the tiresome task of teaching the rudiments as being beneath his notice. I do\nnot think that I need waste much time in pointing\nout how much better it is to absorb the best possible\nprinciples, or how hard it is to get rid of faults which\nhave once become engrained; for it places a double\nburden on the shoulders of the later teacher and\nthe preliminary task of unteaching is harder than\nthat of teaching. It is for this reason that the\nfamous piper Timotheus is said to have demanded\nfrom those who had previously been under another\nmaster a fee double the amount which he charged\nfor those who came to him untaught. The mistake\nto which I am referring is, however, twofold. First\nthey regard these inferior teachers as adequate for\nthe time being and are content with their instruction\nbecause they have a stomach that will swallow anything this indifference, though blameworthy in\nitself, would yet be tolerable, if the teaching provided\nby these persons were merely less in quantity and\nnot inferior in quality as well. Secondly, and this\nis a still commoner delusion, they think that those\nwho are blest with greater gifts of speaking will not\ncondescend to the more elementary details, and that\nconsequently they sometimes disdain to give attention to such inferior subjects of study and sometimes\nare incapable of so doing. For my part I regard the teacher who is unwilling to attend to such details\nas being unworthy of the name of teacher and as\nfor the question of capacity, I maintain that it is the\nmost capable man who, given the will, is able to do\nthis with most efficiency. For in the first place it is a\nreasonable inference that a man blest with abnormal\npowers of eloquence will have made careful note of\nthe various steps by which eloquence is attained,\nand in the second place the reasoning faculty, which\nis specially developed in learned men, is all-important\nin teaching, while finally no one is eminent in the\ngreater things of his art if he be lacking in the lesser.\nUnless indeed we are asked to believe that while\nPhidias modelled his Jupiter to perfection, the\ndecorative details of the statue would have been\nbetter executed by another artist, or that an orator\ndoes not know how to speak, or a distinguished\nphysician is incapable of treating minor ailments. it may be answered Of course there is. But this eloquent\nteacher whom they fling in my face must be a\nsensible man with a good knowledge of teaching and\nmust be prepared to stoop to his pupil's level, just as\na rapid walker, if walking with a small child, will\ngive him his hand and lessen his own speed and\navoid advancing at a pace beyond the powers of his\nlittle companion. Again it frequently happens that\nthe more learned the teacher, the more lucid and\nintelligible is his instruction. For clearness is the\nfirst virtue of eloquence, and the less talented a man\nis, the more he will strive to exalt and dilate himself,\njust as short men tend to walk on tip-toe and weak men to use threats. As for those whose style is\ninflated or vicious, and whose language reveals a\npassion for high-sounding words or labours under\nany other form of affectation, in my opinion they\nsuffer not from excess of strength but of weakness,\nlike bodies swollen not with the plumpness of\nhealth but with disease, or like men who weary of\nthe direct road betake them to bypaths. Consequently the worse a teacher is, the harder he will\nbe to understand. I have not forgotten that I stated in the preceding book, when I urged that school was preferable\nto home education, that pupils at the commencement of their studies, when progress is as yet\nbut in the bud, are more disposed to imitate their\nschoolfellows than their masters, since such imitation\ncomes more easily to them. Some of my readers\nmay think that the view which I am now maintaining\nis inconsistent with my previous statement. But I\nam far from being inconsistent for my previous\nassertion affords the strongest reason for selecting the\nvery best teachers for our boys; since pupils of a\nfirst rate master, having received a better training,\nwill when they speak say something that may be\nworthy of imitation, while if they commit some\nmistake, they will be promptly corrected. But the\nincompetent teacher on the other hand is quite\nlikely to give his approval to faulty work and by the\njudgment which he expresses to force approval\non the audience. The teacher should therefore be\nas distinguished for his eloquence as for his good\ncharacter, and like Phoenix in the Iliad be able to\nteach his pupil both how to behave and how to\nspeak. I must, however, admit that the general\nopinion is that the untrained speaker is usually\nthe more vigorous. This opinion is due primarily\nto the erroneous judgment of faulty critics, who\nthink that true vigour is all the greater for its lack\nof art, regarding it as a special proof of strength to\nforce what might be opened, to break what might\nbe untied and to drag what might be led. Even a\ngladiator who plunges into the fight with no skill at\narms to help him, and a wrestler who puts forth the\nwhole strength of his body the moment he has got\na hold, is acclaimed by them for his outstanding\nvigour, although it is of frequent occurrence in such\ncases for the latter to be overthrown by his own\nstrength and for the former to find the fury of his onslaught parried by his adversary with a supple\nturn of the wrist. But there are many details in this\ndepartment of our art which the unskilled critic will\nnever notice. For instance, careful division under\nheads, although of the utmost importance in actual\ncases, makes the outward show of strength seem\nless than the reality; the unhewn block is larger\nthan the polished marble, and things when scattered\nseem more numerous than when placed together. There is moreover a sort of resemblance between\ncertain merits and certain defects abuse passes for\nfreedom of speech, rashness for courage, prodigality\nfor abundance. But the untrained advocate will\nabuse too openly and too often, even though by so\ndoing he imperils the success of the case which he\nhas undertaken and not seldom his own personal\nsafety as well. But even such violence will win\nmen's good opinion, since they are only too pleased\nto hear another say things which nothing would\nhave induced them to utter themselves. Such\nspeakers are also less careful to avoid that other\nperil, the pitfall of style, and are so reckless in their\nefforts that sometimes in their passion for extravagance they light upon some really striking expression. But such success is rare and does not\ncompensate for their other defects. For the same reason the uninstructed sometimes\nappear to have a richer flow of language, because\nthey say everything that can be said, while the\nlearned exercise discrimination and self-restraint.\nTo this must be added the fact that such persons\ntake no trouble to prove their contentions, and\nconsequently steer clear of the chilly reception\ngiven in our decadent law-courts to arguments and questions and seek only for such themes as may\nbeguile the ears of the public even at the cost of\nappealing to the most perverted tastes. Again,\ntheir epigrams, the sole objects of their quest, seem\nall the more striking because of the dreariness and\nsqualor of their context, since flashes are more\nclearly seen against a background, not of mere as Cicero says, but of pitchy darkness.\nWell, let the world credit them with as much genius\nas it pleases, so long as it is admitted that such\npraise is an insult to any man of real eloquence. None the less it must be confessed that learning\ndoes take something from oratory, just as the file\ntakes something from rough surfaces or the whetstone from blunt edges or age from wine; it takes\naway defects, and if the results produced after subjection to the polish of literary study are less, they\nare less only because they are better. But these creatures have another weapon in their\narmoury they seek to obtain the reputation of\nspeaking with greater vigour than the trained orator\nby means of their delivery. For they shout on all\nand every occasion and bellow their every utterance to use their own phrase,\ndashing this way and that, panting, gesticulating\nwildly and wagging their heads with all the frenzy\nof a lunatic. Smite your hands together, stamp\nthe ground, slap your thigh, your breast, your forehead, and you will go straight to the heart of the\ndingier members of your audience. But the educated speaker, just as he knows how to moderate\nhis style, and to impart variety and artistic form to\nhis speech, is an equal adept in the matter of delivery and will suit his action to the tone of each portion of his utterances, while, if he has any one\ncanon for universal observance, it is that he should\nboth possess the reality and present the appearance\nof self-control. But the ranters confer the title of\nforce on that which is really violence. You may\nalso occasionally find not merely pleaders, but, what\nis far more shameful, teachers as well, who, after a\nbrief training in the art of speaking, throw method\nto the winds and, yielding to the impulse of the\nmoment, run riot in every direction, abusing those\nwho hold literature in higher respect as fools without life, courage or vigour, and calling them the\nfirst and worst name that occurs to them. Still let\nme congratulate these gentlemen on attaining eloquence without industry, method or study. As for\nmyself I have long since retired from the task of\nteaching in the schools and of speaking in the\ncourts, thinking it the most honourable conclusion to\nretire while my services were still in request, and all\nI ask is to be allowed to console my leisure by\nmaking such researches and composing such instructions as will, I hope, prove useful to young men of\nability, and are, at any rate, a pleasure to myself. Let no one however demand from me a rigid\ncode of rules such as most authors of textbooks have\nlaid down, or ask me to impose on students of rhetoric a system of laws immutable as fate, a system in\nwhich injunctions as to the exordium and its nature\nlead the way; then come the statement of facts and\nthe laws to be observed in this connexion next the\nproposition or, as some prefer, the digression, followed\nby prescriptions as to the order in which the various\nquestions should be discussed, with all the other rules,\nwhich some speakers follow as though they had no choice but to regard them as orders and as if it were\na crime to take any other line. If the whole of rhetoric could be thus embodied in one compact code,\nit would be an easy task of little compass but\nmost rules are liable to be altered by the nature of\nthe case, circumstances of time and place, and by\nhard necessity itself. Consequently the all-important\ngift for an orator is a wise adaptability since he is\ncalled upon to meet the most varied emergencies. What if you should instruct a general, as often as he\nmarshals his troops for battle, to draw up his front in\nline, advance his wings to left and right, and station\nhis cavalry to protect his flank This will perhaps be\nthe best plan, if circumstances allow. But it may\nhave to be modified owing to the nature of the ground,\nif, for instance, he is confronted by a mountain, if a\nriver bars his advance, or his movements are hampered\nby hills, woods or broken country. Or again it may\nbe modified by the character of the enemy or the\nnature of the crisis by which he is faced. On one\noccasion he will fight in line, on another in column,\non one he will use his auxiliary troops, on another his\nlegionaries; while occasionally a feint of flight may\nwin the day. So, too, with the rules of oratory. Is\nthe exordium necessary or superfluous should it be\nlong or short addressed entirely to the judge or\nsometimes directed to some other quarter by the\nemployment of some figure of speech Should the\nstatement of facts be concise or developed at some\nlength continuous or divided into sections and\nshould it follow the actual or an artificial order of\nevents The orator will find the answers to all these\nquestions in the circumstances of the case. So, too,\nwith the order in which questions should be discussed, since in any given debate it may often suit one party\nbest that such and such a question come up first, while their opponents would be best suited by another.\nFor these rules have not the formal authority of laws\nor decrees of the plebs, but are, with all they contain,\nthe children of expediency. I will not deny that it\nis generally expedient to conform to such rules, otherwise I should not be writing now; but if our friend\nexpediency suggests some other course to us, why,\nwe shall disregard the authority of the professors\nand follow her. For my part above all things that in all his pleadings the orator should keep two\nthings constantly in view, what is becoming and what\nis expedient. But it is often expedient and occasionally becoming to make some modification in the\ntime-honoured order. We see the same thing in\npictures and statues. Dress, expression and attitude\nare frequently varied. The body when held bolt\nupright has but little grace, for the face looks straight\nforward, the arms hang by the side, the feet are\njoined and the whole figure is stiff from top to toe.\nBut that curve, I might almost call it motion, with\nwhich we are so familiar, gives an impression of action\nand animation. So, too, the hands will not always be\nrepresented in the same position, and the variety\ngiven to the expression will be infinite. Some figures\nare represented as running or rushing forward, others\nsit or recline, some are nude, others clothed, while\nsome again are half-dressed, half-naked. Where can\nwe find a more violent and elaborate attitude than\nthat of the Discobolus of Myron Yet the critic who disapproved of the figure because it was not upright,\nwould merely show his utter failure to understand the\nsculptor's art, in which the very novelty and difficulty\nof execution is what most deserves our praise. A\nsimilar impression of grace and charm is produced by\nrhetorical figures, whether they be figures of thought\nor figures of speech. For they involve a certain departure from the straight line and have the merit of\nvariation from the ordinary usage. In a picture the\nfull face is most attractive. But Apelles painted\nAntigonus in profile, to conceal the blemish caused\nby the loss of one eye. So, too, in speaking, there\nare certain things which have to be concealed, either\nbecause they ought not to be disclosed or because\nthey cannot be expressed as they deserve. Timanthes,\nwho was, I think, a native of Cythnus, provides an\nexample of this in the picture with which he won the\nvictory over Colotes of Teos. It represented the\nsacrifice of Iphigenia, and the artist had depicted an\nexpression of grief on the face of Calchas and of still\ngreater grief on that of Ulysses, while he had given\nMenelaus an agony of sorrow beyond which his art\ncould not go. Having exhausted his powers of emotional expression he was at a loss to portray the\nfather's face as it deserved, and solved the problem\nby veiling his head and leaving his sorrow to the\nimagination of the spectator. Sallust did something similar when he wrote It\nhas always, therefore, been my custom not to tie myself down to universal or general rules this being the\nnearest equivalent I can find for the Greek catholic\nrules. For rules are rarely of such a kind that their\nvalidity cannot be shaken and overthrown in some particular or other. But I must reserve each of these\npoints for fuller treatment in its proper place. For\nthe present I will only say that I do not want young\nmen to think their education complete when they\nhave mastered one of the small text-books of which\nso many are in circulation, or to ascribe a talismanic\nvalue to the arbitrary decrees of theorists. the art\nof speaking can only be attained by hard work and\nassiduity of study, by a variety of exercises and repeated trial, the highest prudence and unfailing\nquickness of judgement. But rules are helpful all the\nsame so long as they indicate the direct road and do\nnot restrict us absolutely to the ruts made by others.\nFor he who thinks it an unpardonable sin to leave the\nold, old track, must be content to move at much the\nsame speed as a tight-rope walker. Thus, for example,\nwe often leave a paved military road to take a short\ncut or, finding that the direct route is impossible\nowing to floods having broken down the bridges, are\nforced to make a circuit, while if our house is on fire\nand flames bar the way to the front door, we make\nour escape by breaking through a party wall. The\norator's task covers a large ground, is extremely\nvaried and develops some new aspect almost every\nday, so that the last word on the subject will never\nhave been said. I shall however try to set forth the\ntraditional rules and to point out their best features,\nmentioning the changes, additions and subtractions\nwhich seem desirable. Rhetoric is a Greek term which has been\ntranslated into Latin by oratoria or oratrix. I would\nnot for the world deprive the translators of the\npraise which is their due for attempting to increase\nthe vocabulary of our native tongue; but translations from Greek into Latin are not always satisfactory,\njust as the attempt to represent Latin words\nin a Greek dress is sometimes equally unsuccessful. And the translations in question are fully as\nharsh as the essentia and queentia of Plautus,\nand have not even the merit of being exact.\nFor oratoria is formed like elocutoria and oratrix\nlike elocutrix, whereas the rhetoric with which\nwe are concerned is rather to be identified with\neloquentia, and the word is undoubtedly used in two\nsenses by the Greeks. In the one case it is an\nadjective i.e. ars rhetorica, the rhetorical art, like\npiratic in the phrase nauis piratica, in the other it is\na noun like philosophy or friendship. It is as a substantive that we require it here; now the correct\ntranslation of the Greek grammatice is litteratura not\nlitteratrix or litteratoria, which would be the forms\nanalogous to oratrix and oratoria. But in the case of there is no similar Latin equivalent. It is\nbest therefore not to quarrel about it, more especially\nas we have to use Greek terms in many other cases.\nFor I may at least use the words philosophus, musicus\nand geometres without outraging them by changing\nthem into clumsy Latin equivalents. Finally,\nsince Cicero gave a Greek title to the earlier works\nwhich he wrote on this subject, I may without fear\nof rashness accept the great orator as sufficient\nauthority for the name of the art which he professed. To resume, then, rhetoric for I shall now use the\nname without fear of captious criticism is in my\nopinion best treated under the three following heads,\nthe art, the artist and the work. The art is that\nwhich we should acquire by study, and is the art of speaking well. The artist is he who has acquired the\nart, that is to say, he is the orator whose task it is\nto speak well. The work is the achievement of\nthe artist, namely good speaking. Each of these\nthree general divisions is in its turn divided into\nspecies. Of the two latter divisions I shall speak\nin their proper place. For the present I shall proceed to a discussion of the first. The first question which confronts us is Many definitions have been\ngiven; but the problem is really twofold. For the\ndispute turns either on the quality of the thing\nitself or on the meaning of the words in which it\nis defined. The first and chief disagreement on the\nsubject is found in the fact that some think that\neven bad men may be called orators, while others,\nof whom I am one, restrict the name of orator and\nthe art itself to those who are good. Of those who\ndivorce eloquence from that yet fairer and more desirable title to renown, a virtuous life, some call\nrhetoric merely a power, some a science, but not a\nvirtue, some a practice, some an art, though they will\nnot allow the art to have anything in common with\nscience or virtue, while some again call it a perversion of art or These persons have as a\nrule held that the task of oratory lies in persuasion\nor speaking in a persuasive manner for this is\nwithin the power of a bad man no less than a good.\nHence we get the common definition of rhetoric as\nthe power of persuading. What I call a power,\nmany call a capacity, and some a faculty. In order\ntherefore that there may be no misunderstanding I\nwill say that by power I mean This view\nis derived from Isocrates, if indeed the treatise on rhetoric which circulates under his name is really\nfrom his hand. He, although far from agreeing\nwith those whose aim is to disparage the duties of\nan orator, somewhat rashly defined rhetoric as the  for\nI cannot bring myself to use the peculiar derivative\nwhich Ennius applies to Marcus Cethegus in the\nphrase suadae medulla, the Again Gorgias,in the dialogue of Plato that takes\nits title from his name, says practically the same\nthing, but Plato intends it to be taken as the opinion\nof Gorgias, not as his own. Cicero in more than\none passage defined the duty of an orator as In his Rhelorica too,\na work which it is clear gave him no satisfaction, he\nmakes the end to be persuasion. But many other\nthings have the power of persuasion, such as money,\ninfluence, the authority and rank of the speaker, or\neven some sight unsupported by language, when\nfor instance the place of words is supplied by the\nmemory of some individual's great deeds, by his\nlamentable appearance or the beauty of his person. Thus when Antonius in the course of his defence of\nManius Aquilius tore open his client's robe and revealed the honourable scars which he had acquired\nwhile facing his country's foes, he relied no longer\non the power of his eloquence, but appealed directly\nto the eyes of the Roman people. And it is believed\nthat they were so profoundly moved by the sight as\nto acquit the accused. Again there is a speech of\nCato, to mention no other records, which informs us\nthat Servius Galba escaped condemnation solely by the pity which he aroused not only by producing his\nown young children before the assembly, but by\ncarrying round in his arms the son of Sulpicius\nGallus. So also according to general opinion Phryne\nwas saved not by the eloquence of Hyperides, admirable as it was, but by the sight of her exquisite\nbody, which she further revealed by drawing aside\nher tunic. And if all these have power to persuade, the end of oratory, which we are discussing,\ncannot adequately be defined as persuasion. Consequently those who, although holding the same\ngeneral view of rhetoric, have regarded it as the\npower of persuasion by speaking, pride themselves on\ntheir greater exactness of language. This definition\nis given by Gorgias, in the dialogue mentioned\nabove, under compulsion from the inexorable logic of\nSocrates. Theodectes agrees with him, whether the\ntreatise on rhetoric which has come down to us\nunder his name is really by him or, as is generally\nbelieved, by Aristotle. In that work the end of\nrhetoric is defined as the leading of men by the\npower of speech to the conclusion desired by the orator. But even this definition is not sufficiently comprehensive, since others besides orators persuade by\nspeaking or lead others to the conclusion desired, as\nfor example harlots, flatterers and seducers. On\nthe other hand the orator is not always engaged on\npersuasion, so that sometimes persuasion is not his\nspecial object, while sometimes it is shared by\nothers who are far removed from being orators. And\nyet Apollodorus is not very far off this definition\nwhen he asserts that the first and all-important task\nof forensic oratory is to persuade the judge and lead\nhis mind to the conclusions desired by the speaker. For even Apollodorus makes the orator the sport of fortune by refusing him leave to retain his title if he\nfails to persuade. Some on the other hand pay no\nattention to results, as for example Aristotle, who\nsays This definition has not merely\nthe fault already mentioned, but the additional defect of including merely the power of invention,\nwhich without style cannot possibly constitute\noratory. Hermagoras, who asserts that its end is to\nspeak persuasively, and others who express the same\nopinion, though in different words, and inform us\nthat the end is to say everything which ought to be\nsaid with a view to persuasion, have been sufficiently\nanswered above, when I proved that persuasion was\nnot the privilege of the orator alone. Various additions\nhave been made to these definitions. For some hold\nthat rhetoric is concerned with everything, while\nsome restrict its activity to politics. The question\nas to which of these views is the nearer to the truth\nshall be discussed later in its appropriate place. Aristotle seems to have implied that the sphere of the\norator was all-inclusive when he defined rhetoric as\nthe power to detect every element in any given subject\nwhich might conduce to persuasion; so too does Patrocles who omits the words in any given subject, but\nsince he excludes nothing, shows that his view is\nidentical. For he defines rhetoric as the power to\ndiscover whatever is persuasive in speech. These definitions like that quoted above include no more than\nthe power of invention alone. Theodorus avoids this\nfault and holds that it is the power to discover and to\nutter forth in elegant language whatever is credible in\nevery subject of oratory. But, while others besides orators may discover what is credible as well as persuasive, by adding the words in every subject he, to a\ngreater extent than the others, concedes the fairest\nname in all the world to those who use their gifts as\nan incitement to crime . Plato makes Gorgias say\nthat he is a master of persuasion in the law-courts\nand other assemblies, and that his themes are justice\nand injustice, while in reply Socrates allows him the\npower of persuading, but not of teaching. Those\nwho refused to make the sphere of oratory allinclusive, have been obliged to make somewhat forced\nand long-winded distinctions among these I may\nmention Ariston, the pupil of the Peripatetic Critolaus, who produced the following definition, Being a Peripatetic he\nregards it as a science, not, like the Stoics, as a\nvirtue, while in adding the words he inflicts a positive insult on\noratory, in implying that it is not likely to persuade the\nlearned. The same criticism will apply to all those who\nrestrict oratory to political questions, for they exclude thereby a large number of the duties of an\norator, as for example panegyric, the third department of oratory, which is entirely ignored. Turning\nto those who regard rhetoric as an art, but not as a\nvirtue, we find that Theodorus of Gadara is more\ncautious. For he says I quote the words of his\ntranslators, Similarly Cornelius Celsus defines the end of rhetoric as to speak persuasively on any doubtful subject within the\nfield of politics. Similar definitions are given by\nothers, such for instance as the following There are countless other definitions,\neither identical with this or composed of the same\nelements, which I shall deal with when I come to\nthe questions concerned with the subject matter of\nrhetoric. Some regard it as neither a power, a\nscience or an art; Critolaus calls it the practice of\nspeaking for this is the meaning of ,\nAthenaeus styles it the art of deceiving, while the\nmajority, content with reading a few passages from\nthe Gorgias of Plato, unskilfully excerpted by\nearlier writers, refrain from studying that dialogue\nand the remainder of Plato's writings, and thereby\nfall into serious error. For they believe that in\nPlato's view rhetoric was not an art, but a certain\nadroitness in the production of delight and gratification, or with reference to another passage the\nshadow of a small part of politics and the fourth department of flattery. For Plato assigns two departments of politics to the body, namely medicine and\ngymnastic, and two to the soul, namely law and\njustice, while he styles the art of cookery a form of\nflattery of medicine, the art of the slave-dealer a\nflattery of gymnastic, for they produce a false complexion by the use of paint and a false robustness\nby puffing them out with fat sophistry he calls a\ndishonest counterfeit of legal science, and rhetoric of\njustice. All these statements occur in the Gorgias and\nare uttered by Socrates who appears to be the mouthpiece of the views held by Plato. But some of his\ndialogues were composed merely to refute his\nopponents and are styled refutative, while others are\nfor the purpose of teaching and are called doctrinal. Now it is only rhetoric as practised in their own day\nthat is condemned by Plato or Socrates, for he\nspeaks of it as  rhetoric in itself he regards as a\ngenuine and honourable thing, and consequently the\ncontroversy with Gorgias ends with the words, To this Gorgias\nmakes no reply, but the argument is taken up by\nPolus, a hot-headed and headstrong young fellow,\nand it is to him that Socrates makes his remarks\nabout and Then\nCallicles, who is even more hot-headed, intervenes,\nbut is reduced to the conclusion that It is clear therefore that\nPlato does not regard rhetoric as an evil, but holds\nthat true rhetoric is impossible for any save a just\nand good man. In the Phaedrus he makes it even\nclearer that the complete attainment of this art is\nimpossible without the knowledge of justice, an\nopinion in which I heartily concur. Had this not\nbeen his view, would he have ever written the\nApology of Socrates or the Funeral Oration in\npraise of those who had died in battle for their\ncountry, both of them works falling within the\nsphere of oratory. It was against the class of men\nwho employed their glibness of speech for evil purposes that he directed his denunciations. Similarly\nSocrates thought it incompatible with his honour to make use of the speech which Lysias composed for\nhis defence, although it was the usual practice in\nthose days to write speeches for the parties concerned to speak in the courts on their own behalf,\na device designed to circumvent the law which forbade the employment of advocates. Further the\nteachers of rhetoric were regarded by Plato as quite\nunsuited to their professed task. For they divorced\nrhetoric from justice and preferred plausibility to\ntruth, as he states in the Phaedrus. Cornelius Celsus\nseems to have agreed with these early rhetoricians,\nfor he writes and again a little later If this were true, only the worst of men\nwould place such dangerous weapons at the disposal\nof criminals or employ the precepts of their art for\nthe assistance of wickedness. However I will leave\nthose who maintain these views to consider what\nground they have for so doing. For my part, I have undertaken the task of moulding the ideal orator, and as my first desire is that he\nshould be a good man, I will return to those who\nhave sounder opinions on the subject. Some however identify rhetoric with politics, Cicero calls it a\ndepartment of the science of politics and science of\npolitics and philosophy are identical terms, while\nothers again call it a branch of philosophy, among\nthem Isocrates. The definition which best suits its\nreal character is that which makes rhetoric the science\nof speaking well. For this definition includes all the\nvirtues of oratory and the character of the orator as\nwell, since no man can speak well who is not good\nhimself. The definition given by Chrysippus, who derived it from Cleanthes, to the effect that it is the\nscience of speaking rightly, amounts to the same thing.\nThe same philosopher also gives other definitions,\nbut they concern problems of a different character\nfrom that on which we are now engaged. Another\ndefinition defines oratory as the power of persuading\nmen to do what ought to be done, and yields practically\nthe same sense save that it limits the art to the result\nwhich it produces. Areus again defines it well as\nspeaking according to the excellence of speech. Those who\nregard it as the science of political obligations, also\nexclude men of bad character from the title of orator,\nif by science they mean virtue, but restrict it overmuch by confining it to political problems. Albutius,\na distinguished author and professor of rhetoric,\nagrees that rhetoric is the science of speaking well,\nbut makes a mistake in imposing restrictions by the\naddition of the words on political questions and with\ncredibility; with both of these restrictions I have\nalready dealt. Finally those critics who hold that\nthe aim of rhetoric is to think and speak rightly, were\non the correct track. These are practically all the most celebrated and\nmost discussed definitions of rhetoric. It would be\nboth irrelevant and beyond my power to deal with all.\nFor I strongly disapprove of the custom which has\ncome to prevail among writers of text-books of refusing\nto define anything in the same terms as have been\nemployed by some previous writer. I will have\nnothing to do with such ostentation. What I say\nwill not necessarily be my own invention, but it will\nbe what I believe to be the right view, as for instance\nthat oratory is the science of speaking well. For\nwhen the most satisfactory definition has been found, he who seeks another, is merely looking for a\nworse one. Thus much being admitted we are now in\na position to see clearly what is the end, the\nhighest aim, the ultimate goal of rhetoric, that in fact which every art must possess. For if rhetoric\nis the science of speaking well, its end and highest\naim is to speak well. There follows the question as to whether\nrhetoric is useful. Some are in the habit of\ndenouncing it most violently and of shamelessly\nemploying the powers of oratory to accuse oratory\nitself. they say The comic poets even accuse\nSocrates of teaching how to make the worse cause\nseem the better, while Plato says that Gorgias and\nTisias made similar professions. And to these they\nadd further examples drawn from the history of\nRome and Greece, enumerating all those who used\ntheir pernicious eloquence not merely against individuals but against whole states and threw an ordered\ncommonwealth into a state of turmoil or even brought\nit to utter ruin; and they point out that for this\nvery reason rhetoric was banished from Sparta, while\nits powers were cut down at Athens itself by the fact\nthat an orator was forbidden to stir the passions of\nhis audience. On the showing of these critics not only\norators but generals, magistrates, medicine and philosophy itself will all be useless. For Flaminius was a\ngeneral, while men such as the Gracchi, Saturninus\nand Glaucia were magistrates. Doctors have been\ncaught using poisons, and those who falsely assume the\nname of philosopher have occasionally been detected\nin the gravest crimes. Let us give up eating, it\noften makes us ill; let us never go inside houses,\nfor sometimes they collapse on their occupants;\nlet never a sword be forged for a soldier, since\nit might be used by a robber. And who does\nnot realise that fire and water, both necessities of\nlife, and, to leave mere earthly things, even the sun\nand moon, the greatest of the heavenly bodies, are\noccasionally capable of doing harm. On the other hand will it be denied that it was\nby his gift of speech that Appius the Blind broke\noff the dishonourable peace which was on the point\nof being concluded with Pyrrhus Did not the\ndivine eloquence of Cicero win popular applause\neven when he denounced the Agrarian laws, did it\nnot crush the audacious plots of Catiline and win,\nwhile he still wore the garb of civil life, the highest\nhonour that can be conferred on a victorious general,\na public thanksgiving to heaven Has not oratory\noften revived the courage of a panic-stricken army\nand persuaded the soldier faced by all the perils of\nwar that glory is a fairer thing than life itself Nor\nshall the history of Sparta and Athens move me\nmore than that of the Roman people, who have\nalways held the orator in highest honour. Never in\nmy opinion would the founders of cities have induced their unsettled multitudes to form communities had they not moved them by the magic of their\neloquence never without the highest gifts of oratory would the great legislators have constrained mankind to submit themselves to the yoke of law. Nay,\neven the principles which should guide our life,\nhowever fair they may be by nature, yet have greater\npower to mould the mind to virtue, when the beauty\nof things is illumined by the splendour of eloquence.\nWherefore, although the weapons of oratory may\nbe used either for good or ill, it is unfair to regard\nthat as an evil which can be employed for good. These problems, however, may be left to those\nwho hold that rhetoric is the power to persuade. If\nour definition of rhetoric as the science of speaking\nwell implies that an orator must be a good man,\nthere can be no doubt about its usefulness. And\nin truth that god, who was in the beginning, the\nfather of all things and the architect of the universe,\ndistinguished man from all other living creatures\nthat are subject to death, by nothing more than\nthis, that he gave him the gift of speech. For as\nregards physical bulk, strength, robustness, endurance or speed, man is surpassed in certain cases by\ndumb beasts, who also are far more independent of\nexternal assistance. They know by instinct without\nneed of any teacher how to move rapidly, to feed\nthemselves and swim. Many too have their bodies\nclothed against cold, possess natural weapons and\nhave not to search for their food, whereas in all\nthese respects man's life is full of toil. Reason\nthen was the greatest gift of the Almighty, who\nwilled that we should share its possession with the\nimmortal gods. But reason by itself would help us\nbut little and would be far less evident in us, had\nwe not the power to express our thoughts in speech;\nfor it is the lack of this power rather than thought and understanding, which they do to a certain extent possess, that is the great defect in other living\nthings. The construction of a soft lair, the weaving\nof nests, the hatching and rearing of their young, and\neven the storing up of food for the coming winter,\ntogether with certain other achievements which we\ncannot imitate, such as the making of honey and\nwax, all these perhaps indicate the possession of a\ncertain degree of reason; but since the creatures that\ndo these things lack the gift of speech they are called\ndumb and unreasoning beasts. Finally, how little\nthe heavenly boon of reason avails those who are\nborn dumb. If therefore we have received no fairer\ngift from heaven than speech, what shall we regard\nas so worthy of laborious cultivation, or in what\nshould we sooner desire to excel our fellow-men,\nthan that in which mankind excels all other living\nthings And we should be all the more eager to do\nso, since there is no art which yields a more grateful\nrecompense for the labour bestowed upon it. This\nwill be abundantly clear if we consider the origins\nof oratory and the progress it has made; and it is\ncapable of advancing still further. I will not stop\nto point out how useful and how becoming a task it is\nfor a good man to defend his friends, to guide the\nsenate by his counsels, and to lead peoples or armies\nto follow his bidding; I merely ask, is it not a\nnoble thing, by employing the understanding which\nis common to mankind and the words that are used\nby all, to win such honour and glory that you seem\nnot to speak or plead, but rather, as was said of\nPericles, to thunder and lighten However, if I were to indulge my own inclinations in expatiating on this subject, I should go on for ever. Let us therefore pass to the next\nquestion and consider whether rhetoric is an art. No one of those who have laid down rules for\noratory has ever doubted that it is an art. It is clear\neven from the titles of their books that their theme\nis the art of rhetoric, while Cicero defines rhetoric\nas artistic eloquence. And it is not merely the orators\nwho have claimed this distinction for their studies\nwith a view to giving them an additional title to\nrespect, but the Stoic and Peripatetic philosophers for\nthe most part agree with them. Indeed I will confess\nthat I had doubts as to whether I should discuss this\nportion of my inquiry, for there is no one, I will not\nsay so unlearned, but so devoid of ordinary sense, as\nto hold that building, weaving or moulding vessels\nfrom clay are arts, and at the same time to consider\nthat rhetoric, which, as I have already said, is the\nnoblest and most sublime of tasks, has reached such\na lofty eminence without the assistance of art. For\nmy own part I think that those who have argued\nagainst this view did not realise what they were\nsaying, but merely desired to exercise their wits by\nthe selection of a difficult theme, like Polycrates,\nwhen he praised Busiris and Clytemnestra; I may\nadd that he is credited with a not dissimilar performance, namely the composition of a speech which\nwas delivered against Socrates. Some would have it that rhetoric is a natural gift\nthough they admit that it can be developed by practice.\nSo Antonius in the de Oralore of Cicero styles it a knack\nderived from experience, but denies that it is an art this statement is however not intended to be accepted\nby us as the actual truth, but is inserted to make Antonius speak in character, since he was in the\nhabit of concealing his art. Still Lysias is said to\nhave maintained this same view, which is defended\non the ground that uneducated persons, barbarians\nand slaves, when speaking on their own behalf, say\nsomething that resembles an exordiam, state the facts\nof the case, prove, refute and plead for mercy just as\nan orator does in his peroration. To this is added\nthe quibble that nothing that is based on art can\nhave existed before the art in question, whereas men\nhave always from time immemorial spoken in their\nown defence or in denunciation of others the\nteaching of rhetoric as an art was, they say, a later\ninvention dating from about the time of Tisias and\nCorax oratory therefore existed before art and\nconsequently cannot be an art. For my part I am not\nconcerned with the date when oratory began to be\ntaught. Even in Homer we find Phoenix as an\ninstructor not only of conduct but of speaking, while\na number of orators are mentioned, the various styles\nare represented by the speeches of three of the\nchiefs and the young men are set to contend among\nthemselves in contests of eloquence moreover lawsuits and pleaders are represented in the engravings\non the shield of Achilles. It is sufficient to call\nattention to the fact that everything which art has\nbrought to perfection originated in nature. Otherwise we might deny the title of art to medicine,\nwhich was discovered from the observation of\nsickness and health, and according to some is\nentirely based upon experiment wounds were bound\nup long before medicine developed into an art, and\nfevers were reduced by rest and abstention from food,\nlong before the reason for such treatment was known, simply because the state of the patient's\nhealth left no choice. So too building should not be\nstyled an art; for primitive man built himself a hut\nwithout the assistance of art. Music by the same\nreasoning is not an art; for every race indulges in\nsome kind of singing and dancing. If therefore any\nkind of speech is to be called eloquence, I will admit\nthat it existed before it was an art. If on the other\nhand not every man that speaks is an orator and\nprimitive man did not speak like an orator, my\nopponents must needs acknowledge that oratory is\nthe product of art and did not exist before it. This\nconclusion also rules out their argument that men\nspeak who have never learnt how to speak, and that\nwhich a man does untaught can have no connexion\nwith art. In support of this contention they adduce\nthe fact that Demades was a waterman and Aeschines\nan actor, but both were orators. Their reasoning is\nfalse. For no man can be an orator untaught and it\nwould be truer to say that these orators learned\noratory late in life than that they never learned at all;\nalthough as a matter of fact Aeschines had an\nacquaintance with literature from childhood since his\nfather was a teacher of literature, while as regards\nDemades, it is quite uncertain that he never studied\nrhetoric and in any case continuous practice in\nspeaking was sufficient to bring him to such proficiency as he attained for experience is the best of all\nschools. On the other hand it may fairly be asserted\nthat he would have achieved greater distinction, if he\nhad received instruction for although he delivered\nhis speeches with great effect, he never ventured to\nwrite them for others. Aristotle, it is true, in his\nGryllus produces some tentative arguments to the contrary, which are marked by characteristic\ningenuity. On the other hand he also wrote three\nbooks on the art of rhetoric, in the first of which\nhe not merely admits that rhetoric is an art, but\ntreats it as a department of politics and also of\nlogic. Critolaus and Athenodorus of Rhodes have\nproduced many arguments against this view, while\nAgnon renders himself suspect by the very title of\nhis book in which he proclaims that he is going to\nindict rhetoric. As to the statements of Epicurus\non this subject, they cause me no surprise, for he is\nthe foe of all systematic training. These gentlemen talk a great deal, but the\narguments on which they base their statements are\nfew. I will therefore select the most important of\nthem and will deal with them briefly, to prevent the\ndiscussion lasting to all eternity. Their first contention is based on the subject-matter; for they\nassert that all arts have their own subject-matter\nwhich is true and go on to say that rhetoric has\nnone, which I shall show in what follows to be false. Another slander is to the effect that no art will\nacquiesce in false opinions since an art must be\nbased on direct perception, which is always true\nnow, say they, rhetoric does give its assent to false\nconclusions and is therefore not an art. I will admit\nthat rhetoric sometimes substitutes falsehood for\ntruth, but I will not allow that it does so because its\nopinions are false, since there is all the difference\nbetween holding a certain opinion oneself and\npersuading someone else to adopt an opinion. For\ninstance a general frequently makes use of falsehood Hannibal when hemmed in by Fabius\npersuaded his enemy that he was in retreat by tying brushwood to the horns of oxen, setting fire\nto them by night and driving the herds across\nthe mountains opposite. But though he deceived\nFabius, he himself was fully aware of the truth. Again when the Spartan Theopompus changed\nclothes with his wife and escaped from custody\ndisguised as a woman, he deceived his guards,\nbut was not for a moment deceived as to his own\nidentity. Similarly an orator, when he substitutes\nfalsehood for the truth, is aware of the falsehood\nand of the fact that he is substituting it for the\ntruth. He therefore deceives others, but not himself. When Cicero boasted that he had thrown\ndust in the eyes of the jury in the case of\nCluentius, he was far from being blinded himself.\nAnd when a painter by his artistic skill makes us\nbelieve that certain objects project from the picture,\nwhile others are withdrawn into the background, he\nknows perfectly well that they are really all in the\nsame plane. My opponents further assert that every\nart has some definite goal towards which it directs its\nefforts, but that rhetoric as a rule has no such goal,\nwhile at other times it professes to have an aim, but\nfails to perform its promise. They lie I have already\nshown that rhetoric has a definite purpose and have\nexplained what it is. And, what is more, the orator\nwill always make good his professions in this respect,\nfor he will always speak well. On the other hand\nthis criticism may perhaps hold good as against those\nwho think persuasion the end of oratory. But our\norator and his art, as we define it, are independent of\nresults. The speaker aims at victory, it is true, but if\nhe speaks well, he has lived up to the ideals of his art,\neven if he is defeated. Similarly a pilot will desire to bring his ship safe to harbour; but if he is swept\nout of his course by a storm, he will not for that\nreason cease to be a pilot, but will say in the wellknown words of the old poet So too the doctor seeks to heal the\nsick; but if the violence of the disease or the refusal\nof the patient to obey his regimen or any other\ncircumstance prevent his achieving his purpose, he\nwill not have fallen short of the ideals of his art,\nprovided he has done everything according to reason.\nSo too the orator's purpose is fulfilled if he has spoken\nwell. For the art of rhetoric, as I shall show later,\nis realised in action, not in the result obtained. From\nthis it follows that there is no truth in yet another\nargument which contends that arts know when they\nhave attained their end, whereas rhetoric does not.\nFor every speaker is aware when he is speaking well.\nThese critics also charge rhetoric with doing what\nno art does, namely making use of vices to serve its\nends, since it speaks the thing that is not and excites\nthe passions. But there is no disgrace in doing\neither of these things, as long as the motive be good\nconsequently there is nothing vicious in such action.\nEven a philosopher is at times permitted to tell a lie,\nwhile the orator must needs excite the passions, if\nthat be the only way by which he can lead the\njudge to do justice. For judges are not always\nenlightened and often have to be tricked to prevent\nthem falling into error. Give me philosophers as\njudges, pack senates and assemblies with philosophers,\nand you will destroy the power of hatred, influence,\nprejudice and false witness; consequently there will\nbe very little scope for eloquence whose value will\nlie almost entirely in its power to charm. But if, as is the case, our hearers are fickle of mind, and truth is\nexposed to a host of perils, we must call in art to aid\nus in the fight and employ such means as will help\nour case. He who has been driven from the right road\ncannot be brought back to it save by a fresh detour. The point, however, that gives rise to the greatest\nnumber of these captious accusations against rhetoric,\nis found in the allegation that orators speak indifferently on either side of a case. From which they\ndraw the following arguments no art is self-contradictory, but rhetoric does contradict itself; no art\ntries to demolish what itself has built, but this does\nhappen in the operations of rhetoric; or again\nrhetoric teaches either what ought to be said or what\nought not to be said; consequently it is not an art\nbecause it teaches what ought not to be said, or\nbecause, while it teaches what ought to be said, it\nalso teaches precisely the opposite. Now it is obvious\nthat all such charges are brought against that type\nof rhetoric with which neither good men nor virtue\nherself will have anything to do; since if a case be\nbased on injustice, rhetoric has no place therein and\nconsequently it can scarcely happen even under the\nmost exceptional circumstances that an orator, that\nis to say, a good man, will speak indifferently on either\nside. Still it is in the nature of things conceivable\nthat just causes may lead two wise men to take\ndifferent sides, since it is held that wise men may fight\namong themselves, provided that they do so at the\nbidding of reason. I will therefore reply to their\ncriticisms in such a way that it will be clear that these\narguments have no force even against those who concede the name of orator to persons of bad character.\nFor rhetoric is not self-contradictory. The conflict is between case and case, not between rhetoric and\nitself. And even if persons who have learned the\nsame thing fight one another, that does not prove\nthat what they have learned is not an art. Were\nthat so, there could be no art of arms, since gladiators\ntrained under the same master are often matched\nagainst each other; nor would the pilot's art exist,\nbecause in sea-fights pilots may be found on different\nsides; nor yet could there be an art of generalship,\nsince general is pitted against general. In the same\nway rhetoric does not undo its own work. For the\norator does not refute his own arguments, nor does\nrhetoric even do so, because those who regard persuasion as its end, or the two good men whom chance has\nmatched against one another seek merely for probabilities and the fact that one thing is more credible\nthan another, does not involve contradiction between\nthe two. There is no absolute antagonism between\nthe probable and the more probable, just as there is\nnone between that which is white and that which is\nwhiter, or between that which is sweet and that\nwhich is sweeter. Nor does rhetoric ever teach that\nwhich ought not to be said, or that which is contrary\nto what ought to be said, but solely what ought to be\nsaid in each individual case. But though the orator\nwill as a rule maintain what is true, this will not\nalways be the case there are occasions when the\npublic interest demands that he should defend what\nis untrue. The following objections are also put forward in\nthe second book of Cicero's de Oratore Now one of these points,\nnamely whether the judges have knowledge of what\nis being said to them, has nothing to do with the art\nof oratory. The other statement, that art is concerned\nwith things that are known, does however require an\nanswer. Rhetoric is the art of speaking well and the\norator knows how to speak well. it is urged, Neither do they, who assert that all things derive\ntheir origin from fire or water or the four elements\nor indivisible atoms; nor they who calculate the\ndistances of the stars or the size of the earth and sun.\nAnd yet all these call the subject which they teach\nan art. But if reason makes them seem not merely\nto hold opinions but, thanks to the cogency of the\nproofs adduced, to have actual knowledge, reason will\ndo the same service to the orator. they say, But not even a doctor can tell\nwhether a patient who claims to be suffering from a\nheadache, really is so suffering but he will treat him\non the assumption that his statement is true, and\nmedicine will still be an art. Again what of the fact\nthat rhetoric does not always aim at telling the truth,\nbut always at stating what is probable The answer\nis that the orator knows that what he states is no\nmore than probable. My opponents further object\nthat advocates often defend in one case what they\nhave attacked in another. This is not the fault of the\nart, but of the man. Such are the main points that\nare urged against rhetoric; there are others as well,\nbut they are of minor importance and drawn from the\nsame sources. That rhetoric is an art may, however, be proved in\na very few words. For if Cleanthes definition be\naccepted that no one\ncan doubt that there is such method and order in\ngood speaking while if, on the other hand, we accept\nthe definition which meets with almost universal\napproval that art consists in perceptions agreeing\nand cooperating to the achievement of some useful\nend, we shall be able to show that rhetoric lacks none\nof these characteristics. Again it is scarcely necessary\nfor me to point out that like other arts it is based on\nexamination and practice. And if logic is an art, as\nis generally agreed, rhetoric must also be an art, since\nit differs from logic in species rather than in genus.\nNor must I omit to point out that where it is possible\nin any given subject for one man to act without art\nand another with art, there must necessarily be an\nart in connexion with that subject, as there must also\nbe in any subject in which the man who has received\ninstruction is the superior of him who has not. But\nas regards the practice of rhetoric, it is not merely\nthe case that the trained speaker will get the better\nof the untrained. For even the trained man will\nprove inferior to one who has received a better\ntraining. If this were not so, there would not be so\nmany rhetorical rules, nor would so many great men\nhave come forward to teach them. The truth of this\nmust be acknowledged by everyone, but more\nespecially by us, since we concede the possession of\noratory to none save the good man. Some arts, however, are based on examination, that is to say on the knowledge and proper\nappreciation of things, as for instance astronomy, which demands no action, but is content to understand\nthe subject of its study such arts are called theoretical.\nOthers again are concerned with action this is their\nend, which is realised in action, so that, the action\nonce performed, nothing more remains to do these\narts we style practical, and dancing will provide us\nwith an example. Thirdly there are others which\nconsist in producing a certain result and achieve their\npurpose in the completion of a visible task such we\nstyle productive, and painting may be quoted as an\nillustration. In view of these facts we must come to\nthe conclusion that, in the main, rhetoric is concerned\nwith action; for in action it accomplishes that which\nit is its duty to do. This view is universally accepted,\nalthough in my opinion rhetoric draws largely on the\ntwo other kinds of art. For it may on occasion be\ncontent with the mere examination of a thing.\nRhetoric is still in the orator's possession even though\nhe be silent, while if he gives up pleading either\ndesignedly or owing to circumstances over which he\nhas no control, he does not therefore cease to be an\norator, any more than a doctor ceases to be a doctor\nwhen he withdraws from practice. Perhaps the\nhighest of all pleasures is that which we derive from\nprivate study, and the only circumstances under\nwhich the delights of literature are unalloyed are\nwhen it withdraws from action, that is to say from\ntoil, and can enjoy the pleasure of self-contemplation. But in the results that the orator obtains by writing\nspeeches or historical narratives, which we may reasonably count as part of the task of oratory, we shall\nrecognise features resembling those of a productive\nart. Still, if rhetoric is to be regarded as one of these\nthree classes of art, since it is with action that its practice is chiefly and most frequently concerned, let\nus call it an active or administrative art, the two\nterms being identical. I quite realise that there is a further question as to whether eloquence derives most from\nnature or from education. This question really lies\noutside the scope of our inquiry, since the ideal\norator must necessarily be the result of a blend of\nboth. But I do regard it as of great importance\nthat we should decide how far there is any real\nquestion on this point. For if we make an absolute\ndivorce between the two, nature will still be able to\naccomplish much without the aid of education,\nwhile the latter is valueless without the aid of\nnature. If, on the other hand, they are blended in\nequal proportions, I think we shall find that the\naverage orator owes most to nature, while the perfect orator owes more to education. We may take\na parallel from agriculture. A thoroughly barren\nsoil will not be improved even by the best cultivation,\nwhile good land will yield some useful produce\nwithout any cultivation; but in the case of really\nrich land cultivation will do more for it than its own\nnatural fertility. Had Praxiteles attempted to carve\na statue out of a millstone, I should have preferred\na rough block of Parian marble to any such statue.\nOn the other hand, if the same artist had produced\na finished statue from such a block of Parian marble,\nits artistic value would owe more to his skill than\nto the material. To conclude, nature is the raw\nmaterial for education the one forms, the other is\nformed. Without material art can do nothing,\nmaterial without art does possess a certain value,\nwhile the perfection of art is better than the best\nmaterial. More important is the question whether rhetoric is to be regarded as one of the indifferent arts,\nwhich in themselves deserve neither praise nor blame,\nbut are useful or the reverse according to the character of the artist; or whether it should, as not a few\neven among philosophers hold, be considered as a\nvirtue. For my own part I regard the practice of rhetoric which so many have adopted in the past and still\nfollow to-day, as either no art at all, or, as the Greeks\ncall it, for I see numbers of speakers without the least pretension to method or literary training rushing headlong in the direction in which\nhunger or their natural shamelessness calls them;\nor else it is a bad art such as is styled For there have, I think, been many persons and\nthere are still some who have devoted their powers\nof speaking to the destruction of their fellow-men. There is also an unprofitable imitation of art, a kind\nof which is neither good nor bad, but\nmerely involves a useless expenditure of labour, reminding one of the man who shot a continuous\nstream of vetch-seeds from a distance through the\neye of a needle, without ever missing his aim, and\nwas rewarded by Alexander, who was a witness of\nthe display, with the present of a bushel of vetch-seeds, a most appropriate reward. It is to such men\nthat I would compare those who spend their whole\ntime at the expense of much study and energy in\ncomposing declamations, which they aim at making\nas unreal as possible. The rhetoric on the other\nhand, which I am endeavouring to establish and the\nideal of which I have in my mind's eye, that rhetoric\nwhich befits a good man and is in a word the only\ntrue rhetoric, will be a virtue. Philosophers arrive at this conclusion by a long chain of ingenious\narguments; but it appears to me to be perfectly\nclear from the simpler proof of my own invention\nwhich I will now proceed to set forth. The philosophers state the case as follows. If\nself-consistency as to what should and should not\nbe done is an element of virtue and it is to this\nquality that we give the name of prudence, the\nsame quality will be revealed as regards what should\nbe said and what should not be said, and if there are\nvirtues, of which nature has given us some rudimentary sparks, even before we were taught anything\nabout them, as for instance justice, of which there are\nsome traces even among peasants and barbarians, it\nis clear that man has been so formed from the\nbeginning as to be able to plead on his own behalf,\nnot, it is true, with perfection, but yet sufficiently to\nshow that there are certain sparks of eloquence\nimplanted in us by nature. The same nature, however, is not to be found in those arts which have no\nconnexion with virtue. Consequently, since there are\ntwo kinds of speech, the continuous which is called\nrhetoric, and the concise which is called dialectic the\nrelation between which was regarded by Zeno as being\nso intimate that he compared the latter to the closed\nfist, the former to the open hand, even the art of\ndisputation will be a virtue. Consequently there can\nbe no doubt about oratory whose nature is so much\nfairer and franker. I should like, however, to consider the point\nmore fully and explicitly by appealing to the\nactual work of oratory. For how will the orator\nsucceed in panegyric unless he can distinguish between what is honourable and the reverse How can he urge a policy, unless he has a clear perception of what is expedient How can he plead in\nthe law-courts, if he is ignorant of the nature of\njustice Again, does not oratory call for courage,\nsince it is often directed against the threats of\npopular turbulence and frequently runs into peril\nthrough incurring the hatred of the great, while\nsometimes, as for instance in the trial of Milo, the\norator may have to speak in the midst of a crowd of\narmed soldiers Consequently, if oratory be not a\nvirtue, perfection is beyond its grasp. If, on the\nother hand, each living thing has its own peculiar\nvirtue, in which it excels the rest or, at any rate, the\nmajority I may instance the courage of the lion\nand the swiftness of the horse, it may be regarded\nas certain that the qualities in which man excels\nthe rest are, above all, reason and powers of speech.\nWhy, therefore, should we not consider that the\nspecial virtue of man lies just as much in eloquence as in reason It will be with justice then\nthat Cicero makes Crassus say that and that Cicero himself\ncalls it a virtue in his letters to Brutus and in\nother passages. it may be urged, No doubt; even a\nrobber may fight bravely without courage ceasing to\nbe a virtue; even a wicked slave may bear torture\nwithout a groan, and we may still continue to regard\nendurance of pain as worthy of praise. We can\npoint to many acts which are identical with those of\nvirtue, but spring from other sources. However,\nwhat I have said here must suffice, as I have already\ndealt with the question of the usefulness of oratory. As to the material of oratory, some have\nasserted that it is speech, as for instance Gorgias in\nthe dialogue of Plato. If this view be accepted in\nthe sense that the word is used of a discourse composed on any subject, then it is not the\nmaterial, but the work, just as a statue is the work\nof the sculptor. For speeches like statues require\nart for their production. If on the other hand\nwe interpret as indicating the words\nthemselves, they can do nothing unless they are\nrelated to facts. Some again hold that the material\nconsists of persuasive arguments. But they form\npart of the work, are produced by art and require\nmaterial themselves. Some say that political\nquestions provide the material. The mistake made\nby these lies not in the quality of their opinion\nbut in its limitation. For political questions are\nmaterial for eloquence but not the only material. Some, on the ground that rhetoric is a virtue, make the\nmaterial with which it deals to be the whole of life.\nOthers, on the ground that life regarded as a whole\ndoes not provide material for every virtue, since\nmost of them are concerned only with departments\nof life justice, courage and self-control each having\ntheir own duties and their own end, would consequently restrict oratory to one particular department\nof life and place it in the practical or pragmatic\ndepartment of ethics, that is to say the department\nof morals which deals with the business of life. For my own part, and I have authority to support\nme, I hold that the material of rhetoric is composed of\neverything that may be placed before it as a subject\nfor speech. Plato, if I read him aright, makes\nSocrates say to Gorgias that its material is to be found in things not words; while in the Phaedrus\nhe clearly proves that rhetoric is concerned not\nmerely with law-courts and public assemblies, but with\nprivate and domestic affairs as well from which it is\nobvious that this was the view of Plato himself. Cicero\nalso in a passage of one of his works, states that\nthe material of rhetoric is composed of the things\nwhich are brought before it, but makes certain restrictions as to the nature of these things. In\nanother passage, however, he expresses his opinion\nthat the orator has to speak about all kinds of things;\nI will quote his actual words And in another passage he says, But this material, as we call it, that is to say\nthe things brought before it, has been criticised by\nsome, at times on the ground that it is limitless, and\nsometimes on the ground that it is not peculiar to\noratory, which they have therefore dubbed a discursive art, because all is grist that comes to its mill. I have no serious quarrel with these critics, for they\nacknowledge that rhetoric is concerned with every\nkind of material, though they deny that it has any\npeculiar material just because of that material's multiplicity. But in spite of this multiplicity, rhetoric\nis not unlimited in scope, and there are other minor arts whose material is characterised by the same\nmultiplicity such for instance is architecture, which\ndeals with everything that is useful for the purpose\nof building such too is the engraver's art which\nworks on gold, silver, bronze, iron. As for sculpture,\nits activity extends to wood, ivory, marble, glass and\nprecious stones in addition to the materials already\nmentioned. And things which form the material for\nother artists, do not for that reason cease forthwith\nto be material for rhetoric. For if I ask what is the\nmaterial of the sculptor, I shall be told bronze; and\nif I ask what is the material of the maker of vessels\nI refer to the craft styled by the Greeks,\nthe answer will again be bronze and yet there is\nall the difference in the world between vessels and\nstatues. Similarly medicine will not cease to be an\nart, because, like the art of the gymnast, it prescribes rubbing with oil and exercise, or because it\ndeals with diet like the art of cookery. Again, the\nobjection that to discourse of what is good, expedient\nor just is the duty of philosophy presents no difficulty. For when such critics speak of a philosopher,\nthey mean a good man. Why then should I feel\nsurprised to find that the orator whom I identify with\nthe good man deals with the same material There\nis all the less reason, since I have already shown in\nthe first book that philosophers only usurped this\ndepartment of knowledge after it had been abandoned by the orators it was always the peculiar\nproperty of rhetoric and the philosophers are really\ntrespassers. Finally, since the discussion of whatever is brought before it is the task of dialectic,\nwhich is really a concise form of oratory, why should\nnot this task be regarded as also being the appropriate material for continuous oratory There is a further objection made by certain\ncritics, who say I might answer this criticism in the words of Cicero,\nin whom I find the following passage I however regard it as sufficient that an orator should not be actually ignorant\nof the subject on which he has to speak. For he\ncannot have a knowledge of all causes, and yet he\nshould be able to speak on all. On what then\nwill he speak On those which he has studied.\nSimilarly as regards the arts, he will study those\nconcerning which he has to speak, as occasion may\ndemand, and will speak on those which he has\nstudied. What thenI am askedwill not a builder\nspeak better on the subject of building and a musician on music Certainly, if the orator does not\nknow what is the question at issue. Even an illiterate peasant who is a party to a suit will speak\nbetter on behalf of his case than an orator who does\nnot know what the subject in dispute may be. But\non the other hand if the orator receive instruction\nfrom the builder or the musician, he will put forward what he has thus learned better than either,\njust as he will plead a case better than his client,\nonce he has been instructed in it. The builder and\nthe musician will, however, speak on the subject of\ntheir respective arts, if there should be any technical\npoint which requires to be established. Neither will\nbe an orator, but he will perform his task like an\norator, just as when an untrained person binds up a wound, he will not be a physician, but he will be\nacting as one. Is it suggested that such topics\nnever crop up in panegyric, deliberative or forensic\noratory When the question of the construction of\na port at Ostia came up for discussion, had not the\norator to state his views And yet it was a subject\nrequiring the technical knowledge of the architect. Does not the orator discuss the question whether\nlivid spots and swellings on the body are symptomatic of ill-health or poison And yet that is a\nquestion for the qualified physician. Will he not\ndeal with measurements and figures And yet we\nmust admit that they form part of mathematics. For\nmy part I hold that practically all subjects are\nunder certain circumstances liable to come up for\ntreatment by the orator. If the circumstances do\nnot occur, the subjects will not concern him. We were therefore right in asserting that the\nmaterial of rhetoric is composed of everything that\ncomes before the orator for treatment, an assertion\nwhich is confirmed by the practice of everyday\nspeech. For when we have been given a subject\non which to speak, we often preface our remarks by\ncalling attention to the fact that the matter has\nbeen laid before us. Gorgias indeed felt so strongly\nthat it was the orator's duty to speak on every subject, that he used to allow those who attended his\nlectures to ask him questions on any subject they\npleased. Hermagoras also asserted that the material\nof oratory lay in the cause and the questions it\ninvolved, thereby including every subject that can\nbe brought before it. If he denies that general\nquestions are the concern of oratory, he disagrees\nwith me but if they do concern rhetoric, that supports my contention. For there is nothing which\nmay not crop up in a cause or appear as a question\nfor discussion. Aristotle himself also by his tripartite\ndivision of oratory, into forensic, deliberative and\ndemonstrative, practically brought everything into the\norator's domain, since there is nothing that may not\ncome up for treatment by one of these three kinds of\nrhetoric. A very few critics have raised the question as to\nwhat may be the instrument of oratory. My definition of an instrument is that without which the material\ncannot be brought into the shape necessary for the effecting of our object. But it is not the art which requires an instrument, but the artist. Knowledge\nneeds no instruments, for it may be complete\nalthough it produces nothing, but the artist must\nhave them. The engraver cannot work without his\nchisel nor the painter without his brush. I shall\ntherefore defer this question until I come to treat of\nthe orator as distinct from his art. I shall now proceed to indicate what I think\nshould be the first subjects in which the rhetorician\nshould give instruction, and shall postpone for a\ntime our consideration of the art of rhetoric in the\nnarrow sense in which that term is popularly used.\nFor in my opinion it is most desirable that we\nshould commence with something resembling the\nsubjects already acquired under the teacher of\nliterature. Now there are three forms of narrative, without\ncounting the type used in actual legal cases. First\nthere is the fictitious narrative as we get it in\ntragedies and poems, which is not merely not true\nbut has little resemblance to truth. Secondly, there\nis the realistic narrative as presented by comedies,\nwhich, though not true, has yet a certain verisimilitude. Thirdly there is the historical narrative, which\nis an exposition of actual fact. Poetic narratives\nare the property of the teacher of literature. The\nrhetorician therefore should begin with the historical narrative, whose force is in proportion to its\ntruth. I will, however, postpone my demonstration\nof what I regard as the best method of narration\ntill I come to deal with narration as required in the\ncourts. In the meantime, it will be sufficient to\nurge that it should be neither dry nor jejune for\nwhy spend so much labour over our studies if a bald\nand naked statement of fact is regarded as sufficiently\nexpressive; nor on the other hand must it be\ntortuous or revel in elaborate descriptions, such\nas those in which so many are led to indulge\nby a misguided imitation of poetic licence. Both\nthese extremes are faults; but that which springs\nfrom poverty of wit is worse than that which is due to imaginative excess. For we cannot demand or\nexpect a perfect style from boys. But there is\ngreater promise in a certain luxuriance of mind, in\nambitious effort and an ardour that leads at times to\nideas bordering on the extravagant. I have no objection to a little exuberance in the young learner.\nNay, I would urge teachers too like nurses to be\ncareful to provide softer food for still undeveloped\nminds and to suffer them to take their fill of the milk\nof the more attractive studies. For the time being\nthe body may be somewhat plump, but maturer years\nwill reduce it to a sparer habit. Such plumpness\ngives hope of strength; a child fully formed in\nevery limb is likely to grow up a puny weakling.\nThe young should be more daring and inventive\nand should rejoice in their inventions, even though\ncorrectness and severity are still to be acquired.\nExuberance is easily remedied, but barrenness is\nincurable, be your efforts what they may. To my\nmind the boy who gives least promise is one in\nwhom the critical faculty develops in advance of the\nimagination. I like to see the first fruits of the mind\ncopious to excess and almost extravagant in their\nprofusion. The years as they pass will skim off\nmuch of the froth, reason will file away many\nexcrescences, and something too will be removed\nby what I may perhaps call the wear and tear of\nlife, so long as there is sufficient material to admit\nof cutting and chiselling away. And there will\nbe sufficient, if only we do not draw the plate too\nthin to begin with, so that it runs the risk of being\nbroken if the graver cut too deep. Those of my\nreaders who know their Cicero will not be surprised that I take this view for does he not say  We must, therefore, take especial care, above\nall where boys are concerned, to avoid a dry\nteacher, even as we avoid a dry and arid soil for\nplants that are still young and tender. For with\nsuch a teacher their growth is stunted and their\neyes are turned earthwards, and they are afraid to\nrise above the level of daily speech. Their leanness\nis regarded as a sign of health and their weakness as\na sign of sound judgment, and while they are content that their work should be devoid of faults they\nfall into the fault of being devoid of merit. So let\nnot the ripeness of vintage come too soon nor the\nmust turn harsh while yet in the vat; thus it will\nlast for years and mellow with age. It is worth while too to warn the teacher that\nundue severity in correcting faults is liable at times\nto discourage a boy's mind from effort. He loses\nhope and gives way to vexation, then last of all\ncomes to hate his work and fearing everything attempts nothing. This phenomenon is familiar to\nfarmers, who hold that the pruning-hook should not\nbe applied while the leaves are yet young, for they\nseem to and to be unable\nas yet to endure a scar. The instructor therefore\nshould be as kindly as possible at this stage; remedies, which are harsh by nature, must be applied with\na gentle hand some portions of the work must be\npraised, others tolerated and others altered the\nreason for the alterations should however be given,\nand in some cases the master will illumine an\nobscure passage by inserting something of his own. Occasionally again the teacher will find it useful to\ndictate whole themes himself that the boy may\nimitate them and for the time being love them as if\nthey were his own. But if a boy's composition is so\ncareless as not to admit of correction, I have found\nit useful to give a fresh exposition of the theme and\nto tell him to write it again, pointing out that he\nwas capable of doing better for there is nothing\nlike hope for making study a pleasure. Different\nages however demand different methods the task\nset and the standard of correction must be proportioned to the pupil's strength. When boys ventured\non something that was too daring or exuberant, I\nused to say to them that I approved of it for the\nmoment, but that the time would come when I\nshould no longer tolerate such a style. The result\nwas that the consciousness of ability filled them with\npleasure, without blinding their judgment. However, to return to the point from which I had\ndigressed. Written narratives should be composed\nwith the utmost care. It is useful at first, when a\nchild has just begun to speak, to make him repeat\nwhat he has heard with a view to improving his\npowers of speech; and for the same purpose, and\nwith good reason, I would make him tell his story\nfrom the end back to the beginning or start in the\nmiddle and go backwards or forwards, but only so\nlong as he is at his teacher's knee and while he is\nincapable of greater effort and is beginning to connect words and things, thereby strengthening the\nmemory. Even so when he is beginning to understand the nature of correct and accurate speech,\nextempore effusions, improvised without waiting\nfor thought to supply the matter or a moment's hesitation before rising to the feet, must not be permitted they proceed from a passion for display that\nwould do credit to a common mountebank. Such\nproceedings fill ignorant parents with senseless pride,\nwhile the boys themselves lose all respect for their\nwork, adopt a conceited bearing, and acquire the\nhabit of speaking in the worst style and actually practising their faults, while they develop an arrogant conviction of their own talents which often proves fatal\neven to the most genuine proficiency. There will be\na special time for acquiring fluency of speech and I\nshall not pass the subject by unnoticed. For the meantime it will suffice if a boy, by dint of taking pains and\nworking as hard as his age will permit, manages to\nproduce something worthy of approval. Let him get\nused to this until it becomes a second nature. It is\nonly he who learns to speak correctly before he can\nspeak with rapidity who will reach the heights that\nare our goal or the levels immediately below them. To narratives is annexed the task of refuting and\nconfirming them, styled anaskeue and kataskeue, from\nwhich no little advantage may be derived. This may\nbe done not merely in connexion with fiction and\nstories transmitted by the poets, but with the actual\nrecords of history as well. For instance we may discuss the credibility of the story that a raven settled\non the head of Valerius in the midst of a combat and\nwith its wings and beak struck the eyes of the Gaul\nwho was his adversary, and a quantity of arguments\nmay be produced on either side or we may discuss\nthe tradition that Scipio was begotten by a serpent,\nor that Romulus was suckled by the she-wolf, or the\nstory of Numa and Egeria. As regards Greek history, it allows itself something very like poetic licence. Again the time and place of some particular occurrence and sometimes even the persons concerned often provide matter for discussion Livy for\ninstance is frequently in doubt as to what actually\noccurred and historians often disagree. From this our pupil will begin to proceed to more\nimportant themes, such as the praise of famous men\nand the denunciation of the wicked. Such tasks are\nprofitable in more than one respect. The mind is\nexercised by the variety and multiplicity of the subject matter, while the character is moulded by the\ncontemplation of virtue and vice. Further wide\nknowledge of facts is thus acquired, from which examples may be drawn if circumstances so demand,\nsuch illustrations being of the utmost value in every\nkind of case. It is but a step from this to practice\nin the comparison of the respective merits of two\ncharacters. This is of course a very similar theme\nto the preceding, but involves a duplication of the\nsubject matter and deals not merely with the nature\nof virtues and vices, but with their degree as well.\nBut the method to be followed in panegyric and invective will be dealt with in its proper place, as it\nforms the third department of rhetoric. As to commonplaces I refer to those in which\nwe denounce vices themselves such as adultery,\ngambling or profligacy without attacking particular persons, they come straight from the courts\nand, if we add the name of the defendant, amount\nto actual accusations. As a rule, however, the\ngeneral character of a commonplace is usually\ngiven a special turn for instance we make our\nadulterer blind, our gambler poor and our profligate\nfar advanced in years. Sometimes too they entail defence for we may speak on behalf of luxury or\nlove, while a pimp or a parasite may be defended in\nsuch a way that we appeal as counsel not for the\ncharacter itself, but to rebut some specific charge\nthat is brought against him. Theses on the other hand are concerned with\nthe comparison of things and involve questions such\nas or These provide the most attractive\nand copious practice in the art of speaking, and are\nmost useful whether we have an eye to the duties\nof deliberative oratory or the arguments of the\ncourts. For instance Cicero in his pro Murena deals\nvery fully with the second of the two problems\nmentioned above. Other theses too belong entirely\nto the deliberative class of oratory, as for instance\nthe questions as to or Put such discussions into\nthe mouths of specific persons and they become\ndeliberative declamations at once. My own teachers used to prepare us for conjectural cases by a form of exercise which was at once\nuseful and attractive they made us discuss and\ndevelop questions such as or and the like. In these exercises our aim\nwas to discover the intention implied, a question\nwhich frequently occurs in controversial declamations.\nSuch themes may perhaps be regarded as a kind of\nchria or moral essay. That certain topics such as the question as to whether we should always believe a witness or\nwhether we should rely on circumstantial evidence,\nare part and parcel of actual forensic pleading is so\nobvious that certain speakers, men too who have\nheld civil office with no small distinction, have\nwritten out passages dealing with such themes, committed them to memory and kept them ready for\nimmediate use, with a view to employing them when\noccasion arose as a species of ornament to be inserted\ninto their extempore speeches. This practice\nfor I am not going to postpone expressing my judgment on itI used to regard a confession of extreme weakness. For how can such men find appropriate arguments in the course of actual cases which\ncontinually present new and different features\nHow can they answer the points that their opponents\nmay bring up how deal a rapid counterstroke in\ndebate or cross-examine a witness if, even in those\nmatters which are of common occurrence and crop\nup in the majority of cases, they cannot give expression to the most familiar thoughts except in words\nprepared so far in advance. And when they produce\nthe same passage in a number of different cases, they\nmust come to loathe it like food that has grown cold\nor stale, and they can hardly avoid a feeling of shame\nat displaying this miserable piece of furniture to an\naudience whose memory must have detected it so\nmany times already like the furniture of the\nostentatious poor, it is sure to shew signs of wear\nthrough being used for such a variety of different\npurposes. Also it must be remembered that there\nis hardly a single commonplace of such universal\napplication that it will fit any actual case, unless\nsome special link is provided to connect it with the subject otherwise it will seem to have been\ntacked on to the speech, not interwoven in its\ntexture, either because it is out of keeping with the\ncircumstances or like most of its kind is inappropriately\nemployed not because it is wanted, but because it is\nready for use. Some speakers, for example, introduce\nthe most long-winded commonplaces just for the sake\nof the sentiments they contain, whereas rightly the\nsentiments should spring from the context. Such\ndisquisitions are at once ornamental and useful, only if\nthey arise from the nature of the case. But the most\nfinished eloquence, unless it tend to the winning of\nthe case, is to say the least superfluous and may even\ndefeat its own purpose. However I must bring this\ndigression to a close. The praise or denunciation of laws requires greater\npowers; indeed they should almost be equal to the\nmost serious tasks of rhetoric. The answer to the\nquestion as to whether this exercise is more nearly\nrelated to deliberative or controversial oratory\ndepends on custom and law and consequently varies\nin different states. Among the Greeks the proposer\nof a law was called upon to set forth his case before\na judge, while in Rome it was the custom to urge\nthe acceptance or rejection of a law before the public\nassembly. But in any case the arguments advanced\nin such cases are few in number and of a definite\ntype. For there are only three kinds of law, sacred,\npublic and private. This division is of rhetorical value\nchiefly when a law is to be praised. For example the\norator may advance from praise to praise by a series of\ngradations, praising an enactment first because it is\nlaw, secondly because it is public, and, finally, designed\nfor the support of religion. As regards the questions which generally arise, they are common to all cases. Doubts may be raised as to whether the mover is\nlegally in a position to propose a law, as happened in\nthe case of Publius Clodius, whose appointment as\ntribune of the plebs was alleged to be unconstitutional. Or the legality of the proposal itself may\nbe impugned in various ways; it may for instance be\nurged that the law was not promulgated within\nseventeen days, or was proposed, or is being proposed on an improper day, or in defiance of the\ntribunicial veto or the auspices or any other legal\nobstacle, or again that it is contrary to some existing law. But such points are not suitable to\nelementary rhetorical exercises, which are not concerned with persons, times or particular cases.\nOther subjects, whether the dispute be real or fictitious, are generally treated on the following lines. The fault must lie either in the words or the\nmatter. As regards the words, the question will\nbe whether they are sufficiently clear or contain\nsome ambiguity, and as regards the matter whether\nthe law is consistent with itself or should be retrospective or apply to special individuals. The point\nhowever which is most commonly raised is the\nquestion whether the law is right or expedient. I\nam well aware that many rhetoricians introduce a\nnumber of sub-divisions in connexion with this latter\nenquiry. I however include under the term right\nall such qualities as justice, piety and religion.\nJustice is however usually discussed under various\naspects. A question may be raised about the acts\nwith which the law is concerned, as to whether they deserve punishment or reward or as to the degree of\npunishment or reward that should be assigned, since\nexcess in either direction is open to criticism. Again\nexpediency is sometimes determined by the nature\nof things, sometimes by the circumstances of the time.\nAnother common subject of controversy is whether\na law can be enforced, while one must not shut one's\neyes to the fact that exception is sometimes taken\nto laws in their entirety, but sometimes only in\npart, examples of both forms of criticism being\nfound in famous speeches. I am well aware, too,\nthat there are laws which are not proposed with\na view to perpetuity, but are concerned with temporary honours or commands, such as the lex Manilia\nwhich is the subject of one of Cicero's speeches.\nThis however is not the place for instructions on\nthis topic, since they depend on the special circumstances of the matters under discussion, not on their\ngeneral characteristics. Such were the subjects on which the ancients as\na rule exercised their powers of speaking, though\nthey called in the assistance of the logicians as well\nto teach them the theory of argument. For it is\ngenerally agreed that the declamation of fictitious\nthemes in imitation of the questions that arise in\nthe law courts or deliberative assemblies came into\nvogue among the Greeks about the time of Demetrius of Phalerum. Whether this type of exercise was actually invented by him I have failed to\ndiscover, as I have acknowledged in another work.\nBut not even those who most strongly assert his\nclaim to be the inventor, can produce any adequate\nauthority in support of their opinion. As regards\nLatin teachers of rhetoric, of whom Plotius was the most famous, Cicero informs us that they came into\nexistence towards the end of the age of Crassus. I will speak of the theory of declamation a\nlittle later. In the mean time, as we are discussing\nthe elementary stages of a rhetorical education, I\nthink I should not fail to point out how greatly the\nrhetorician will contribute to his pupils' progress, if\nhe imitates the teacher of literature whose duty it is\nto expound the poets, and gives the pupils whom he\nhas undertaken to train, instruction in the reading\nof history and still more of the orators. I myself\nhave adopted this practice for the benefit of a few\npupils of suitable age whose parents thought it\nwould be useful. But though my intentions were\nexcellent, I found that there were two serious obstacles to success long custom had established a\ndifferent method of teaching, and my pupils were\nfor the most part full-grown youths who did not\nrequire this form of teaching, but were taking my\nwork as their model. However, the fact that I\nhave been somewhat late in making the discovery is\nnot a reason why I should be ashamed to recommend\nit to those who come after me. I now know that this\nform of teaching is practised by the Greeks, but is\ngenerally entrusted to assistants, as the professors\nthemselves consider that they have no time to give\nindividual instruction to each pupil as he reads. And I admit that the form of lecture which this\nrequires, designed as it is to make boys follow the\nwritten word with ease and accuracy, and even that\nwhich aims at teaching the meaning of any rare\nwords that may occur, are to be regarded as quite\nbelow the dignity of the teacher of rhetoric. On\nthe other hand it is emphatically part of his prosession and the undertaking which he makes in\noffering himself as a teacher of eloquence, to point\nout the merits of authors or, for that matter, any\nfaults that may occur and this is all the more the\ncase, as I am not asking teachers to undertake the\ntask of recalling their pupils to standat their knee once\nmore and of assisting them in the reading of whatever book they may select. It seems to me at once\nan easier and more profitable method to call for\nsilence and choose some one pupiland it will be\nbest to select them by turnsto read aloud, in\norder that they may at the same time learn the\ncorrect method of elocution. The case with which\nthe speech selected for reading is concerned should\nthen be explained, for if this be done they will\nhave a clearer understanding of what is to be read.\nWhen the reading is commenced, no important\npoint should be allowed to pass unnoticed either\nas regards the resourcefulness or the style shown\nin the treatment of the subject the teacher must\npoint out how the orator seeks to win the favour\nof the judge in his exordium, what clearness, brevity\nand sincerity, and at times what shrewd design and\nwell-concealed artifice is shown in the statement of\nfacts. For the only true art in pleading is that\nwhich can only be understood by one who is a\nmaster of the art himself. The teacher will proceed\nfurther to demonstrate what skill is shown in the division into heads, how subtle and frequent are the thrusts\nof argument, what vigour marks the stirring and\nwhat charm the soothing passage, how fierce is the\ninvective and how full of wit the jests, and in\nconclusion how the orator establishes his sway\nover the emotions of his audience, forces his way into their very hearts and brings the feelings of the\njury into perfect sympathy with all his words. Finally as regards the style, he will emphasise the\nappropriateness, elegance or sublimity of particular\nwords, will indicate where the amplification of the\ntheme is deserving of praise and where there is\nvirtue in a diminuendo; and will call attention to\nbrilliant metaphors, figures of speech and passages\ncombining smoothness and polish with a general\nimpression of manly vigour. It will even at times be of value to read speeches\nwhich are corrupt and faulty in style, but still meet\nwith general admiration thanks to the perversity of\nmodern tastes, and to point out how many expressions in them are inappropriate, obscure, high-flown,\ngrovelling, mean, extravagant or effeminate, although\nthey are not merely praised by the majority of critics,\nbut, worse still, praised just because they are bad. For\nwe have come to regard direct and natural speech\nas incompatible with genius, while all that is in any\nway abnormal is admired as exquisite. Similarly we\nsee that some people place a higher value on figures\nwhich are in any way monstrous or distorted than\nthey do on those who have not lost any of the advantages of the normal form of man. There are\neven some who are captivated by the shams of artifice\nand think that there is more beauty in those who\npluck out superfluous hair or use depilatories, who\ndress their locks by scorching them with the curling\niron and glow with a complexion that is not their\nown, than can ever be conferred by nature pure and\nsimple, so that it really seems as if physical beauty\ndepended entirely on moral hideousness. It will, however, be the duty of the rhetorician not merely to teach these things, but to ask frequent\nquestions as well, and test the critical powers of his\nclass. This will prevent his audience from becoming\ninattentive and will secure that his words do not fall\non deaf ears. At the same time the class will be led\nto find out things for themselves and to use their\nintelligence, which is after all the chief aim of this\nmethod of training. For what else is our object in\nteaching, save that our pupils should not always\nrequire to be taught I will venture to say that\nthis particular form of exercise, if diligently pursued,\nwill teach learners more than all the text-books of\nall the rhetoricians these are no doubt of very\nconsiderable use, but being somewhat general in\ntheir scope, it is quite impossible for them to deal\nwith all the special cases that are of almost daily\noccurrence. The art of war will provide a parallel\nit is no doubt based on certain general principles,\nbut it will none the less be far more useful to know\nthe methods employed, whether wisely or the reverse, by individual generals under varying circumstances and conditions of time and place. For there\nare no subjects in which, as a rule, practice is not\nmore valuable than precept. Is a teacher to declaim\nto provide a model for his audience, and will not\nmore profit be derived from the reading of Cicero or\nDemosthenes Is a pupil to be publicly corrected\nif he makes a mistake in declaiming, and will it not\nbe more useful, and more agreeable too, to correct\nsome actual speech For everyone has a preference\nfor hearing the faults of others censured rather than\nhis own. I might say more on the subject. But\nevery one can see the advantages of this method.\nWould that the reluctance to put it into practice were not as great as the pleasure that would undoubtedly be derived from so doing This method once adopted, we are faced by the\ncomparatively easy question as to what authors\nshould be selected for our reading. Some have recommended authors of inferior merit on the ground\nthat they were easier to understand. Others on the\ncontrary would select the more florid school of writers\non the ground that they are likely to provide the\nnourishment best suited to the minds of the young. For my part I would have them read the best authors\nfrom the very beginning and never leave them,\nchoosing those, however, who are simplest and most\nintelligible. For instance, when prescribing for boys,\nI should give Livy the preference over Sallust;\nfor, although the latter is the greater historian,\none requires to be well-advanced in one's studies\nto appreciate him properly. Cicero, in my opinion,\nprovides pleasant reading for beginners and is sufficiently easy to understand it is possible not only\nto learn much from him, but to come to love him.\nAfter Cicero I should, following the advice of Livy,\nplace such authors as most nearly resemble him. There are two faults of taste against which boys\nshould be guarded with the utmost care. Firstly\nno teacher suffering from an excessive admiration\nof antiquity, should be allowed to cramp their\nminds by the study of Cato and the Gracchi and\nother similar authors. For such reading will give\nthem a harsh and bloodless style, since they will as\nyet be unable to understand the force and vigour of\nthese authors, and contenting themselves with a\nstyle which doubtless was admirable in its day, but\nis quite unsuitable to ours, will come to think and nothing could be more fatal that they really resemble great men. Secondly the opposite extreme must\nbe equally avoided they must not be permitted to\nfall victims to the pernicious allurements of the\nprecious blooms produced by our modern euphuists,\nthus acquiring a passion for the luscious sweetness\nof such authors, whose charm is all the more attractive to boyish intellects because it is so easy of\nachievement. Once, however, the judgment is\nformed and out of danger of perversion, I should\nstrongly recommend the reading of ancient authors,\nsince if, after clearing away all the uncouthness of\nthose rude ages, we succeed in absorbing the robust\nvigour and virility of their native genius, our more\nfinished style will shine with an added grace\nI also approve the study of the moderns at\nthis stage, since even they have many merits. For nature has not doomed us to be dullards,\nbut we have altered our style of oratory and indulged our caprices over much. It is in their ideals\nrather than their talents that the ancients show\nthemselves our superiors. It will therefore be\npossible to select much that is valuable from modern\nwriters, but we must take care that the precious\nmetal is not debased by the dross with which it is\nso closely intermingled. Further I would not\nmerely gladly admit, but would even contend that\nwe have recently had and still have certain authors\nwho deserve imitation in their entirety. But it is\nnot for everyone to decide who these writers are.\nError in the choice of earlier authors is attended\nwith less danger, and I have therefore postponed\nthe study of the moderns, for fear that we should\nimitate them before we are qualified to judge of\ntheir merits. I come now to another point in which the\npractice of teachers has differed. Some have not been\ncontent with giving directions as to the arrangement of the subjects set them as themes for\ndeclamation, but have developed them at some\nlength themselves, supplying not merely the proofs,\nbut the lines upon which the emotional passages\nshould proceed. Others have merely suggested a\nbare outline, and then when the declamations were\nover, have indicated the points missed by each\nspeaker and worked up certain passages with no less\ncare than they would have used, had they been going\nto stand up to speak themselves. Both practices\nhave their advantages, and therefore I will not give\neither the pre-eminence. But if we must choose one\nof the two, it will be found more profitable to point\nout the right road at the outset, and not merely to\nrecall the pupil from his error when he has already\ngone astray, since in the first place the correction\nis only received by the ear, whereas when he is\ngiven a sketch of the various heads of the declamation, he has to take them down and think about\nthem secondly instruction is always more readily\nreceived than reproof. Indeed those of our pupils\nwho have a lively disposition are liable in the\npresent condition of manners to lose their temper\nwhen admonished and to offer silent resistance. That, however, is no reason for refraining from\nthe public correction of faults; for we must take\nthe rest of the class into account, who will believe\nthat whatever has not been corrected by the master\nis right. The two methods should be employed\nconjointly and in such a way as circumstances may\ndemand. Beginners must be given a subject sketched out ready for treatment and suitable to\ntheir respective powers. But when they show that\nthey have formed themselves sufficiently closely on\nthe models placed before them, it will be sufficient\nto give them a few brief hints for their guidance\nand to allow them to advance trusting in their own\nstrength and without external support. Sometimes\nthey should be left entirely to their own devices,\nthat they may not be spoilt by the bad habit of\nalways relying on another's efforts, and so prove incapable of effort and originality. But as soon as\nthey seem to have acquired a sound conception of\nwhat they ought to say, the teacher's work will be\nnear completion if they still make some mistakes,\nthey must be brought back under his guidance. We\nmay draw a lesson from the birds of the air, whom\nwe see distributing the food which they have collected in their bills among their weak and helpless\nnestlings; but as soon as they are fledged, we see\nthem teaching their young to leave the nest and fly\nround about it, themselves leading the way; finally,\nwhen they have proved their strength, they are given\nthe freedom of the open sky and left to trust in\nthemselves. There is one practice at present in vogue\nfor boys of the age under discussion, which ought\nin my opinion undoubtedly to be changed. They\nshould not be forced to commit all their own compositions to memory and to deliver them on an\nappointed day, as is at present the custom. This\npractice is especially popular with the boys' fathers,\nwho think that their sons are not really studying\nunless they declaim on every possible occasion,\nalthough as a matter of fact progress depends mainly on industry. For though I strongly approve of boys writing compositions and would have\nthem spend as much time as possible over such\ntasks, I had much rather that for the purpose of\nlearning by heart passages should be selected from\nthe orators or historians or any other works that\nmay be deserving of such attention. For it is a\nbetter exercise for the memory to learn the words\nof others than it is to learn one's own, and those\nwho have practised this far harder task will find\nno difficulty in committing to memory their own\ncompositions with which they are already familiar.\nFurther they will form an intimate acquaintance\nwith the best writings, will carry their models\nwith them and unconsciously reproduce the style\nof the speech which has been impressed upon the\nmemory. They will have a plentiful and choice\nvocabulary and a command of artistic structure and\na supply of figures which will not have to be\nhunted for, but will offer themselves spontaneously from the treasure-house, if I may so call it,\nin which they are stored. In addition they will\nbe in the agreeable position of being able to\nquote the happy sayings of the various authors, a\npower which they will find most useful in the\ncourts. For phrases which have not been coined\nmerely to suit the circumstances of the lawsuit of\nthe moment carry greater weight and often win\ngreater praise than if they were our own. I\nwould however allow boys occasionally to declaim\ntheir own compositions that they may reap the reward of their labours in the applause of a large\naudience, that most coveted of all prizes. But this\nshould not be permitted until they have produced something more finished than usual they will thus\nbe rewarded for their industry and rejoice in the\nthought that the privilege accorded them is the\nrecompense of merit. It is generally and not unreasonably regarded\nas the sign of a good teacher that he should be able\nto differentiate between the abilities of his respective\npupils and to know their natural bent. The gifts of\nnature are infinite in their variety, and mind differs\nfrom mind almost as much as body from body. This\nis clear from a consideration of the orators themselves, who differ in style to such an extent that no\none is like another, in spite of the fact that numbers\nhave modelled their style on that of their favorite\nauthors. Many again think it useful to direct their\ninstruction to the fostering of natural advantages and\nto guide the talents of their pupils along the lines\nwhich they instinctively tend to follow. Just as an\nexpert gymnast, when he enters a gymnasium full of\nboys, after testing body and mind in every way, is\nable to decide for what class of athletic contest they\nshould be trained, even so, they say, a teacher of\noratory after careful observation of a boy's stylistic\npreferences, be they for terseness and polish, energy,\ndignity, charm, roughness, brilliance or wit, will so\nadapt his instructions to individual needs that each\npupil will be pushed forward in the sphere for which\nhis talents seem specially to design him; for nature,\nwhen cultivated, goes from strength to strength,\nwhile he who runs counter to her bent is ineffective\nin those branches of the art for which he is less\nsuited and weakens the talents which he seemed\nborn to employ. Now, since the critic who is\nguided by his reason is free to dissent even from received opinions, I must insist that to my thinking this view is only partially true. It is undoubtedly necessary to note the individual gifts of\neach boy, and no one would ever convince me\nthat it is not desirable to differentiate courses of\nstudy with this in view. One boy will be better\nadapted for the study of history, another for poetry,\nanother for law, while some perhaps had better be\npacked off to the country. The teacher of rhetoric\nwill distinguish such special aptitudes, just as our\ngymnast will turn one pupil into a runner, another\ninto a boxer or wrestler or an expert at some other\nof the athletic accomplishments for which prizes are\nawarded at the sacred games. But on the other\nhand, he who is destined for the bar must study not\none department merely, but must perfect himself in\nall the accomplishments which his profession demands, even though some of them may seem too hard\nfor him when he approaches them as a learner. For if\nnatural talent alone were sufficient, education might\nbe dispensed with. Suppose we are given a pupil\nwho, like so many, is of depraved tastes and swollen\nwith his own conceit; shall we suffer him to go his\nown sweet way If a boy's disposition is naturally\ndry and jejune, ought we not to feed it up or at any\nrate clothe it in fairer apparel For, if in some cases\nit is necessary to remove certain qualities, surely\nthere are others where we may be permitted to add\nwhat is lacking. Not that I would set myself against\nthe will of nature. No innate good quality should be\nneglected, but defects must be made good and weaknesses made strong. When Isocrates, the prince of\ninstructors, whose works proclaim his eloquence no\nless than his pupils testify to his excellence as a teacher, gave his opinion of Ephorus and Theopompus\nto the effect that the former needed the spur and the\nlatter the curb, what was his meaning Surely not\nthat the sluggish temperament of the one and the\nheadlong ardour of the other alike required modification by instruction, but rather that each would gain\nfrom an admixture of the qualities of the other. In the case of weaker understandings however some\nconcession must be made and they should be directed\nmerely to follow the call of their nature, since thus\nthey will be more effective in doing the only thing\nthat lies in their power. But if we are fortunate\nenough to meet with richer material, such as justifies\nus in the hope of producing a real orator, we must\nleave no oratorical virtue uncared for. For though he\nwill necessarily have a natural bent for some special\ndepartment of oratory, he will not feel repelled by\nthe others, and by sheer application will develop his\nother qualities until they equal those in which he\nnaturally excels. The skilled gymnast will once again\nprovide us with a parallel if he undertakes to train\na pancratiast, he will not merely teach him how\nto use his fists or his heels, nor will he restrict\nhis instructions to the holds in wrestling, giving\nspecial attention to certain tricks of this kind,\nbut will train him in every department of the\nscience. Some will no doubt be incapable of attaining proficiency in certain exercises; these must\nspecialise on those which lie within their powers. For there are two things which he must be most\ncareful to avoid first, he must not attempt the impossible, secondly he must not switch off his pupil\nfrom what he can do well to exercises for which he is\nless well suited. But if his pupil is like the famous Nicostratus, whom we saw when he was old and we\nwere boys, he will train him equally in every department of the science and will make him a champion\nboth in boxing and wrestling, like Nicostratus himself\nwho won the prize for both contests within a few days\nof each other. And how much more important is the\nemployment of such methods where our future orator\nis concerned It is not enough to be able to speak\nwith terseness, subtlety or vehemence, any more than\nit would be for a singing master to excel in the upper,\nmiddle or lower register only, or in particular sections\nof these registers alone. Eloquence is like a harp\nand will never reach perfection, unless all its strings\nbe taut and in tune. Though I have spoken in some detail of the\nduties of the teacher, I shall for the moment confine\nmy advice to the learners to one solitary admonition,\nthat they should love their masters not less than\ntheir studies, and should regard them as the parents\nnot indeed of their bodies but of their minds. Such\nattachments are of invaluable assistance to study.\nFor under their influence they find it a pleasure to\nlisten to their teachers, believe what they say and\nlong to be like them, come cheerfully and gladly to\nschool, are not angry when corrected, rejoice when\npraised, and seek to win their master's affection by\nthe devotion with which they pursue their studies. For as it is the duty of the master to teach, so it is\nthe duty of the pupil to show himself teachable. The\ntwo obligations are mutually indispensable. And just\nas it takes two parents to produce a human being,\nand as the seed is scattered in vain, if the ground is\nhard and there is no furrow to receive it and bring it\nto growth, even so eloquence can never come to maturity, unless teacher and taught are in perfect\nsympathy. These elementary stages are in themselves\nno small undertaking, but they are merely members\nand portions of the greater whole; when therefore\nthe pupil has been thoroughly instructed and exercised in these departments, the time will as a rule\nhave come for him to attempt deliberative and\nforensic themes. But before I begin to discuss\nthese, I must say a few words on the theory of\ndeclamation, which is at once the most recent and\nmost useful of rhetorical exercises. For it includes\npractically all the exercises of which we have been\nspeaking and is in close touch with reality. As a\nresult it has acquired such a vogue that many think\nthat it is the sole training necessary to the formation\nof an orator, since there is no excellence in a formal\nspeech which is not also to be found in this type of\nrhetorical exercise. On the other hand the actual\npractice of declamation has degenerated to such an\nextent owing to the fault of our teachers, that it has\ncome to be one of the chief causes of the corruption\nof modern oratory; such is the extravagance and\nignorance of our declaimers. But it is possible to\nmake a sound use of anything that is naturally sound. The subjects chosen for themes should, therefore, be\nas true to life as possible, and the actual declamation\nshould, as far as may be, be modelled on the pleadings for which it was devised as a training. For we\nshall hunt in vain among sponsions and interdicts\nfor magicians and plagues and oracles and stepmothers more cruel than any in tragedy, and other subjects still more unreal than these. What then\nare we never to permit young men to handle unreal\nor, to be more accurate, poetic themes that they may\nrun riot and exult in their strength and display their\nfull stature It were best to prohibit them absolutely.\nBut at any rate the themes, however swelling and\nmagnificent, should not be such as to seem foolish\nand laughable to the eye of an intelligent observer.\nConsequently, if we must make some concession, let\nus allow the declaimer to gorge himself occasionally, as long as he realises that his case will be like\nthat of cattle that have blown themselves out with a\nsurfeit of green food they are cured of their disorder\nby blood-letting and then put back to food such as\nwill maintain their strength; similarly the declaimer\nmust be rid of his superfluous fat, and his corrupt\nhumours must be discharged, if he wants to be\nstrong and healthy. Otherwise, the first time he\nmakes any serious effort, his swollen emptiness will\nstand revealed. Those, however, who hold that\ndeclamation has absolutely nothing in common with\npleading in the courts, are clearly quite unaware of\nthe reasons which gave rise to this type of exercise. For if declamation is not a preparation for the actual\nwork of the courts, it can only be compared to the\nrant of an actor or the raving of a lunatic. For what\nis the use of attempting to conciliate a non-existent\njudge, or of stating a case which all know to be\nfalse, or of trying to prove a point on which judgment will never be passed Such waste of effort\nis, however, a comparative trifle. But what can be\nmore ludicrous than to work oneself into a passion\nand to attempt to excite the anger or grief of\nour hearers, unless we are preparing ourselves by such mimic combats for the actual strife and the\npitched battles of the law-courts Is there then no\ndifference between our declamations and genuine\nforensic oratory I can only reply, that if we speak\nwith a desire for improvement, there will be no\ndifference.  wish indeed that certain additions\ncould be made to the existing practice; that we made\nuse of names, that our fictitious debates dealt with\nmore complicated cases and sometimes took longer\nto deliver, that we were less afraid of words drawn\nfrom everyday speech and that we were in the habit\nof seasoning our words with jests. For as regards\nall these points, we are mere novices when we come\nto actual pleading, however elaborate the training\nthat the schools have given us on other points. And\neven if display is the object of declamation, surely\nwe ought to unbend a little for the entertainment of\nour audience. For even in those speeches which,\nalthough undoubtedly to some extent concerned\nwith the truth, are designed to charm the multitude such for instance as panegyrics and the oratory\nof display in all its branches, it is permissible to\nbe more ornate and not merely to disclose all the\nresources of our art, which in cases of law should as\na rule be concealed, but actually to flaunt them\nbefore those who have been summoned to hear us. Declamation therefore should resemble the truth,\nsince it is modelled on forensic and deliberative\noratory. On the other hand it also involves an\nelement of display, and should in consequence\nassume a certain air of elegance. In this connexion\nI may cite the practice of comic actors, whose delivery is not exactly that of common speech, since\nthat would be inartistic, but is on the other hand not far removed from the accents of nature, for, if it were,\ntheir mimicry would be a failure what they do therefore is to exalt the simplicity of ordinary speech\nby a touch of stage decoration. So too we shall\nhave to put up with certain inconveniences arising\nfrom the nature of our fictitious themes; such drawbacks occur more especially in connexion with those\nnumerous details which are left uncertain and which\nwe presume to suit our purpose, such as the ages of\nour characters, their wealth, their families, or the\nstrength, laws and manners of the cities where our\nscenes are laid, and the like. Sometimes we even\ndraw arguments from the actual flaws of the assumptions involved by the theme. But each of these\npoints shall be dealt with in its proper place. For\nalthough the whole purpose of this work is the\nformation of an orator, I have no intention of passing\nover anything that has a genuine connexion with the\npractice of the schools, for fear that students may\ncomplain of the omission. I have now arrived at the point when I must\nbegin to deal with that portion of the art at which\nthose who have omitted the preceding stages generally commence. I can see, however, that certain\ncritics will attempt to obstruct my path at the very\noutset for they will urge that eloquence can dispense with rules of this kind and, in smug satisfaction with themselves and the ordinary methods\nand exercises of the schools, will laugh at me for\nmy pains; in which they will be only following the\nexample of certain professors of no small reputation.\nOne of these gentlemen, I believe, when asked to\ndefine a figure and a thought, replied that he did not\nknow what they were, but that, if they had anything to do with the subject, they would be found in\nhis declamation. Another when asked whether he\nwas a follower of Theodorus or Apollodorus, replied, To do him justice, he could hardly have found a\nneater way to avoid confessing his ignorance. These\npersons, just because, thanks to their natural gifts,\nthey are regarded as brilliant performers and have,\nas a matter of fact, uttered much that deserves to\nbe remembered, think that, while most men share\ntheir careless habits, few come near them for talent. Consequently they make it their boast that they\nspeak on impulse and owe their success to their\nnative powers; they further assert that there is no\nneed of proof or careful marshalling of facts when\nwe are speaking on fictitious themes, but only of\nsome of those sounding epigrams, the expectation of\nwhich has filled the lecture-room; and these they\nsay are best improvised on the spur of the moment. Further, owing to their contempt for method, when\nthey are meditating on some future effusion, they\nspend whole days looking at the ceiling in the hope\nthat some magnificent inspiration may occur to\nthem, or rock their bodies to and fro, booming\ninarticulately as if they had a trumpet inside them\nand adapting their agitated movements, not to the\ndelivery of the words, but to their pursuit. Some\nagain settle on certain definite openings long before they have thought what they are going to say,\nwith a view to using them as pegs for subsequent\nsnatches of eloquence, and then after practising\ntheir delivery first in silent thought and then\naloud for hours together, in utter desperation of\nproviding any connecting links, abandon them and take refuge in one formula after another, each no\nless hackneyed and familiar than the last. The\nleast unreasonable of them devote their attention not to the actual cases, but to their purple\npatches, in the composition of which they pay no\nattention to the subject-matter, but fire off a series\nof isolated thoughts just as they happen to come to\nhand. The result is a speech which, being composed of disconnected passages having nothing in\ncommon with each other, must necessarily lack\ncohesion and can only be compared to a schoolboy's\nnotebook, in which he jots down any passages from\nthe declamations of others that have come in for a\nword of praise. None the less they do occasionally\nstrike out some good things and some fine epigrams,\nsuch as they make their boast. Why not slaves\nand barbarians sometimes achieve the same effects,\nand if we are to be satisfied with this sort of thing,\nthen good-bye to any theory of oratory. IN the second book the subject of inquiry\nwas the nature and the end of rhetoric, and I proved\nto the best of my ability that it was an art, that it\nwas useful, that it was a virtue and that its material\nwas all and every subject that might come up for\ntreatment. I shall now discuss its origin, its component parts, and the method to be adopted in handling and forming our conception of each. For most\nauthors of text-books have stopped short of this,\nindeed Apollodorus confines himself solely to forensic\noratory. I know that those who asked me to write\nthis work were specially interested in that portion on\nwhich I am now entering, and which, owing to the\nnecessity of examining a great diversity of opinions, at\nonce forms by far the most difficult section of this work,\nand also, I fear, may be the least attractive to my\nreaders, since it necessitates a dry exposition of rules. In other portions of this work I have attempted to\nintroduce a certain amount of ornateness, not, I may\nsay, to advertise my style if I had wished to do that, I\ncould have chosen a more fertile theme, but in order\nthat I might thus do something to lure our young\nmen to make themselves acquainted with those principles which I regarded as necessary to the study of\nrhetoric for I hoped that by giving them something\nwhich was not unpleasant to read I might induce a\ngreater readiness to learn those rules which I feared might, by the dryness and aridity which must necessarily characterise their exposition, revolt their minds\nand offend their ears which are nowadays grown\nsomewhat over-sensitive. Lucretilus has the same\nobject in mind when he states that he has set forth\nhis philosophical system in verse; for you will remember the well known simile which he uses and the rest. But I fear that this book will have\ntoo little honey and too much wormwood, and that\nthough the student may find it a healthy draught,\nit will be far from agreeable. I am also haunted by\nthe further fear that it will be all the less attractive\nfrom the fact that most of the precepts which it contains are not original, but derived from others, and\nbecause it is likely to rouse the opposition of certain\npersons who do not share my views. For there are\na large number of writers, who though they are all\nmoving toward the same goal, have constructed\ndifferent roads to it and each drawn their followers\ninto their own. The latter, however, approve of\nthe path on which they have been launched whatever its nature, and it is difficult to change the convictions implantted in boyhood, for the excellent reason\nthat everybody prefers to have learned rather than\nto be in process of learning. But, as will appear in\nthe course of this book, there is an infinite diversity\nof opinions among writers on his subject, since some\nhave added their own discoveries to those portions\nof the art which were still shapeless and unformed, and subsequently have altered even what was perfectly sound in order to establish a claim to\noriginality. The first writer after those recorded by the poets\nwho is said to have taken any steps in the direction\nof rhetoric is Empedocles. But the earliest writers\nof text-books are the Sicilians, Corax and Tisias,\nwho were followed by another from the same island,\nnamely Gorgias of Leontini, whom tradition asserts\nto have been the pupil of Empedocles. He, thanks to\nhis length of days, for he lived to a hundred and nine,\nflourished as the contemporary of many rhetoricians,\nwas consequently the rival of those whom I have\njust mentioned, and lived on to survive Socrates. In the same period flourished Thrasymachus of\nChalcedon, Prodicus of Ceos, Protagoras of Abdera,\nfor whose instructions, which he afterwards published\nin a text-book, Euathlus is said to have paid 10,000\ndenarii, Hippias of Elis and Alcidamas of Elaea whom\nPlato calls Palamedes. There was Antiphon also,\nwho was the first to write speeches and who also wrote\na text-book and is said to have spoken most eloquently in his own defence; Polycrates, who, as\nhave already said, wrote a speech against Socrates,\nand Theodorus of Byzantium, who was one of those\ncalled by Plato. Of these Protagoras and Gorgias are said to have been the\nfirst to treat commonplaces, Prodicus, Hippias,\nProtagoras and Thrasymachus the first to handle\nemotional themes. Cicero in the Brutus states\nthat nothing in the ornate rhetorical style was\never committed to writing before Pericles, and that\ncertain of his speeches are still extant. For my\npart I have been unable to discover anything in the least worthy of his great reputation for eloquence,\nand am consequently the less surprised that there\nshould be some who hold that he never committed\nanything to writing, and that the writings circulating under his name are the works of others. These\nrhetoricias had many successors, but the most\nfamous of Gorgias' pupils was Isocrates, although\nour authorities are not agreed as to who was his\nteacher I however accept the statement of Aristotle\non the subject. From this point the roads begin to\npart. The pupils of Isocrates were eminent in every\nbranch of study, and when he was already advanced\nin years and he lived to the age of ninety-eight,\nAristotle began to teach the art of rhetoric in his\nafternoon lectures, in which he frequently quoted\nthe wel-known line from the Philoctetes in the form Both Aristotle and Isocrates left text-books on\nrhetoric, but that by Aristotle is the larger and contains more books. Theodectes, whose work I mentioned above, also lived about the same period while\nTheophrastus, the pupil of Aristotle, produced some\ncareful work on rhetoric. After him we may note\nthat the philosophers, more especially the leaders of\nthe Stoic and Peripatetic schools, surpassed even\nthe rhetoricians in the zeal which they devoted to\nthe subject. Hermagoras next carved out a path of\nhis own, which numbers have followed of his rivals\nAthenaeus seems to have approached him most nearly. Later still much work was done by Apollonius Molon, Areus, Caecilius and Dionysius of\nHalicarnassus. But the rhetoricians who attracted\nthe most enthusiastic following were Apollodorus of\nPergamus, who was the instructor of Augustus Caesar\nat Apollonia, and Theodorus of Gadara, who preferred\nto be called Theodorus of Rhodes it is said that\nTiberius Caesar during his retirement in that island\nwas a constant attendant at his lectures. These\nrhetoricians taught different systems, and two schools\nhave arisen known as the Apollodoreans and the\nTheodoreans, these names being modelled on the\nfashion of nomenclature in vogue with certain schools\nof philosophy. The doctrines of Apollodorus are\nbest learned from his pupils, among whom Cains\nValgius was the best interpreter of his master's views\nin Latin, Atticus in Greek. The only text-book by\nApollodorus himself seems to be that addressed to\nMatius, as his letter to Domitius does not acknowledge the other works attributed to him. The\nwritings of Theodorus were more numerous, and\nthere are some still living who have seen his pupil\nHerinagoras. The first Roman to handle the subject was, to the\nbest of my belief, Marcus Cato, the famous censor,\nwhile after him Marcus Antonius began a treatise on\nrhetoric I say because only this one work of\nhis survives, and that is incomplete. he was followed\nby others of less note, whose names I will not omit to\nmention, should occasion demand. But it was Cicero\nwho shed the greatest light not only on the practice\nbut on the theory of oratory; for he stands alone\namong Romans as combining the gift of actual eloquence with that of teaching the art. With him for predecessor it would be more modest to be silent, but\nfor the fact that he himself describes his Rhetorica\nas a youthful indiscreition, while in his later works on\noratory he deliberately omitted the discussion of\ncertain minor points, on which instruction is generally\ndesired. Cornificius wrote a good deal, Stertinius\nsomething, and the elder Gallio a little on the same\nsubject. But Gallio's predecessors, Celsus and Laenas,\nand in our own day Verginius, Pliny and Tutilius,\nhave treated rhetoric with greater accuracy. Even\nto-day we have some distinguished writers on oratory\nwho, if they had dealt with the subject more comprehensively, would have saved me the trouble of\nwriting this book. But I will spare the names of the\nliving. The time will come when they will reap their\nmeed of praise; for their merits will endure to after\ngenerations, while the calunmies of envy will perish\nutterly. Still, although so many writers have preceded me,\nI shall not shrink from expressing my own opinion on\ncertain points. I am not a superstitious adherent of\nany school, and as this book will contain a collection\nof the opinions of many different authurs, it was desirable to leave it to my readers to selcet what they\nwill. I shall be content if they praise me for my\nindustry, wherever there is no scope for originality. The question as to the origin of rhetoric need\nnot keep us long. For who can doubt that mankind\nreceived the gift of speech from nature at its birth\nfor we can hardly go further back than that, while\nthe usefulness of speech brought improvement and\nstudy, and finally method and exercise gave perfection I cannot understand why some hold that\nthe elaboration of speech originated in the fact that those who were in peril owing to some accusation\nbeing made against them, set themselves to speak\nwith studied care for the purpose of their own defence. This, however, though a more honourable origin, cannot possibly be the earlier, for\naccusation necessarily precedes defence. You might\nas well assert that the sword was invented for the\npurpose of self-defence and not for aggression. It\nwas, then, nature that created speech, and observation that originated the art of speaking. Just as men\ndiscovered the art of medicine by observing that some\nthings were healthy and some the reverse, so they\nobserved that some things were useful and some useless in speaking, and noted them for imitation or\navoidance, while they added certain other precepts\naccording as their nature suggested. These observations were confirmed by experience and each man\nproceeded to teach what he knew. Cicero, it is\ntrue, attributes the origin of oratory to the founders\nof cities and the makers of laws, who must needs\nhave possessed the gift of eloquence. But why he\nthinks this the actual origin, I cannot understand,\nsince there still exist certain nomad peoples without\ncities or laws, and yet members of these peoples perform the duties of ambassadors, accuse and defend,\nand regard one man as a better speaker than\nanother. The art of oratory, as taught by most authorities, and those the best, consists of five parts-\ninvention, arrangement, expression, memory, and delivery\nor action the two latter terms being used synonymously. But all speech expressive of purpose involves\nalso a subject and words. If such expression is brief and contained within the limits of one sentence, it\nmay demand nothing more, but longer speeches\nrequire much more. For not only what we say\nand how we say it is of importance, but also\nthe circumstances under which we say it. It is here\nthat the need of arrangement comes in. But it will\nbe impossible to say everything demanded by the\nsubject, putting each thing in its proper place, without\nthe aid of memory. It is for this reason that memory\nforms the fourth department. But a delivery, which\nis rendered unbecoming cither by voice or gesture,\nspoils everything and almost entirely destroys the\neffect of what is said. Delivery therefore must be\nassigned the fifth place. Those and Albutins is among them, who maintain\nthat there are only three departments on the ground\nthat memory and delivery for which I shall give\ninstructions in their proper place are given us by\nnature not by art, may be disregarded, although\nThrasymachus held the same views as regards delivery. Some have added a sixth department, subjoining judgment to invention, on the ground that it is\nnecessary first to invented and then to exercise our judgment. For my own part I do not believe that invention\ncan exist apart from judgement, since we do not say that a\nspeaker has invented incousistent, two-edged or foolish\narguments, but merely that he has failed to avoid\nthem. It is true that Cicero in his Rhetorica includes judgment under mention; but in my opinion\njudgment is so inextricably mingled with the first\nthree departments of rhetoric for without judgment\nneither expression nor arrangement are possible, that\nI think that even delivery owes much to it. I say\nthis with all the greater confidence because Cicero in his Partitiones oratoriae arrives at the same five-fold\ndivision of which I have just spoken. For after an\ninitial division of oratory into invention and expression,\nhe assigns matter and arrangement to invention, words\nand delivery to expression, and makes memory a fifth\ndepartment common to them all and acting as their\nguardian. Again in the Orator he states that eloquence consists of five things, and in view of the fact\nthat this is a later work we may accept this as his\nmore settled opinion. Others, who seem to me to\nhave been no less desirous than those mentioned\nabove to introduce some novelty, have added order,\nalthough they had already mentioned arrangement,\nas though arrangement was anything else than the\nmarshalling of arguments in the best possible order.\nDion taught that oratory consisted only of invention\nand arrangement, but added that each of these departments was twofold in nature, being concerned with\nwords and things, so that expression comes under\ninvention, and delivery under arrangement, while memory\nmust be added as a fifth department. The followers\nof Theodorus divide invention into two parts, the one\nconcerned with matter and the other with expression,\nand then add the three remaining departments. Hermagoras places judgment, division, order and\neverything relating to expression under the heading\nof economy, a Greek word meaning the management\nof domestic affairs which is applied metaphorically to\noratory and has no Latin equivalent. A further question arises at this point, since\nsome make memory follow invention in the list of\ndepartments, while others make it follow arrangement.\nPersonally I prefer to place it fourth. For we ought\nnot merely to retain in our minds the fruits of our invention, in order that we may be able to arrange\nthem, or to remember our arraangement in order that\nwe may express it, but we must also commit to\nmemory the words which we propose to use, since\nmemory embraces everything that goes to the compposition of a speech. There are also not a few who have held that these\nare not parts of rhetoric, but rather duties to be\nobserved by the orator. For it is his business to\ninvent, arrange, express, etcetera. If, however, we\naccept this view, we leave nothing to art. For\nalthough the orator's task is to speak well, rhetoric\nis the science of speaking well. Or if we adopt\nanother view, the task of the artist is to persuade,\nwhile the power of persuasion resides in the art.\nConsequently, while it is the duty of the orator to\ninvent and arrange, intention and arrangement may be\nregarded as belonging to rhetoric. At this point\nthere has been much disagreement, as to whether\nthese are parts or duties of rhetoric, or, as Athenaeus\nbelieves, elements of rhetoric, which the Greeks call But they cannot correctly be called elements. For in that case we should have to regard\nthem merely as first-principles, like the moisture, fire,\nmatter or atoms of which the universe is said to be\ncomposed. Nor is it correct to call them duties, since\nthey are not preformed by others, but perform something themselves. We must therefore conclude that\nthey are parts. For since rhetoric is composed of\nthem, it follows that, since a whole consists of parts,\nthese must be parts of the whole which they compose. Those who have called them duties seem to\nme to have been further influenced by the fact that\nthey wished to reserve the name of parts for another division of rhetoric for they asserted that the parts\nof rhetoric were, panegyric, deliberative and forensic\noratory. But if these are parts, they are parts rather\nof the material than of the art. For each of them\ncontains the whole of rhetoric, since each of them\nrequires invention, arrangement, expression, memory and\ndelivery. Consequently some writers have thought\nit better to say that there are three kinds of oratory;\nthose whom Cicero has followed seem to me to\nhave taken the wisest course in terming them kinds\nof causes. There is, however, a dispute as to whether\nthere are three kinds or more. But it is quite certain that all the most eminent authorities among\nancient writers, following Aristotle who merely substituted the term public for deliberative, have been\ncontent with the threefold division. Still a feeble\nattempt has been made by certain Greeks and by\nCicero in his de Oratore, to prove that there are not\nmerely more than three, but that the number of\nkinds is almost past calculation and this view has\nalmost been thrust down our throats by the greatest\nauthority of our own times. Indeed if we place the\ntask of praise and denunciation in the third division,\non what kind of oratory are we to consider ourselves\nto be employed, when we complain, console, pacify,\nexcite, terrify, encourage, instruct, explain obscurities,\nnarrate, plead for mercy, thank, congratulate, reproach, abuse, describe, command, retract, express\nour desires and opinions, to mention no other of the\nmany possibilities As an adherent of the older view\nI must ask for indulgence and must enquire what was\nthe reason that led earlier writers to restrict a subject of such variety to such narrow bounds. Those who\nthink such authorities in error hold that they were\ninfluenced by the fact that these three subjects\npractically exhausted the range of ancient oratory. For it was customary to write panegyrics and denunciations and to deliver funeral orations, while the\ngreater part of their activities was devoted to the\nlaw-courts and deliberative assemblies; as a result,\nthey say, the old writers of text-books only included\nthose kinds of oratory which were most in vogue. The\ndefenders of antiquity point out that there are three\nkinds of audience one which comes simply for the\nsake of getting pleasure, a second which meets to receive advice, a third to give judgement on causes.\nIn the course of a thorough enquiry into the question\nit has occurred to me that the tasks of oratory must\neither be concerned with the law-courts or with themes\nlying outside the law-courts. The nature of the\nquestions into which enquiry is made in the courts is\nobvious. As regards those matters which do not\ncome before a judge, they must necessarily be concerned either with the past or the future. We praise\nor denounce past actions, we deliberate about the\nfuture. Again everything on which we have to\nspeak must be either certain or doubtful. We praise\nor blame what is certain, as our inclination leads us\non the other hand where doubt exists, in some cases\nwe are free to form our own views, and it is here that\ndeliberation comes in, while in others, we leave the\nproblem to the decision of others, and it is on these\nthat litigation takes place. Anaximenes regarded forensic and public oratory\nas genera but held that there were seven species\nexhortation, dissuasion, praise, denunciation, accusation, defence, inquiry, or as he called it The first two, however, clearly belong to deliberative, the next to demonstrative, the three last to\nforensic oratory. I say nothing of Protagoras, who\nheld that oratory was to be divided only into the\nfollowing heads question and answer, command and\nentreaty, or as he calls it Plato in his\nSophist in addition to public and forensic oratory\nintroduces a third kind which he styles which I will permit myself to translate by This is distinct from forensic oratory and\nis adapted for private discussions, and we may regard\nit as identical with dialectic. Isocrates held that\npraise and blame find a place in every kind of\noratory. The safest and most rational course seems to be to\nfollow the authority of the majority. There is,\nthen, as I have said, one kind concerned with praise\nand blame, which, however, derives its name from\nthe better of its two functions and is called laudatory; others however call it demonstrative. Both\nnames are believed to be derived from the Greek in\nwhich the corresponding terms are encomiastic, and\nepideictic. The term epideictic seems to me however\nto imply display rather than demonstration, and to\nhave a very different meaning from encomiastic. For\nalthough it includes laudatory oratory, it does not\nconfine itself thereto. Will any one deny the title\nof epideictic to panegyric But yet panegyrics are advisory in form and frequently discuss the interests\nof Greece. We may therefore conclude that, while\nthere are three kinds of oratory, all three devote\nthemselves in part to the matter in land, and in\npart to display. But it may be that Romans are not borrowing from Greek when they apply the title\ndemonstrative but are merely led to do so because\npraise and blame demonstrate the nature of the\nobject with which they are concerned. The second\nkind is deliberative, the third forensic oratory. All\nother species fall under these three genera you will\nnot find one in which we have not to praise or\nblame, to advise or dissuade, to drive home or refute\na charge, while conciliation, narration, proof, exaggeration, extenuation and the moulding of the minds\nof the audience by exciting or allaying their passions, are common to all three kind of oratory. I\ncannot even agree with those who hold that laudalory subjects are concerned with the question of\nwhat is honourable, deliberative with the question of\nwhat is expedient, and forensic with tie question of\nwhat is just the division thus made is easy and\nneat rather than true for all three kinds rely on\nthe mutual assistance of the other. For we deal\nwith justice and expediency in punegyric and with\nhonour in deliberations, while you will rarely find a\nforensic case, in part of which at any rate something\nof those questions just mentioned is not to be found. Every speech however consists at once of that\nwhich is expressed and that which expresses, that is\nto say of matter and words. Skill in speaking is\nperfected by nature, art and practice, to which some\nadd a fourth department, namely imitation, which I\nhowever prefer to include under art. There are also\nthree aims which the orator must always have in\nview; he must instruct, move and charm his hearers.\nThis is a clearer division than that made by those\nwho divide the task of oratory into that which relates\nto things and that which concerns the emotions, since both of these will not always be present in the\nsubjects which we shall have to treat. For some\nthemes are far from calling for any appeal to the\nemotions, which, although room cannot always be\nfound for them, produce a most powerful effect\nwherever they do succeed in forcing their way. The\nbest authorities hold that there are some things in\noratory which require proof and others which do not,\na view with which I agree. Some on the other hand,\nas for instance Celsus, think that the orator will not\nspeak on any subject unless there is some question\ninvolved in it; but the majority of writers on rhetoric\nare against him, as is also the threefold division of\noratory, unless indeed to praise what is allowed to be\nhonourable and to denounce what is admittedly disgraceful are no part of an orator's duty. It is, however, universally agreed that all questions\nmust be concerned either with something that is\nwritten or something that is not. Those concerned with\nwhat is written are questions of law, those which concern what is not written are questions of fact. Hermagoras calls the latter rational questions, the former\nlegal questions, for so we may translate and Those who hold that every question concerns either things or words, mean much the same. It is also agreed that questions are either definite\nor indefinite. Indefinite questions are those which may\nbe maintained or impugned without reference to\npersons, time or place and the like. The Greeks call\nthem theses, Cicero propositions, others general questions\nrelating to civil life, others again questions suited for\nphilosophical discussion, while Athenaeus calls them\nparts of a cause. Cicero distinguishes two kinds,\nthe one concerned with knowledge, the other with\naction. Thus is a question of knowledge, while is a question of action. The\nfirst involves three questions, whether a thing\nis, what it is, and of what nature for all these\nthings may be unknown the second involves two,\nhow to obtain power and how to use it. Definite\nquestions involve facts, persons, time and the like.\nThe Greeks call them hypotheses, while we call them\ncauses. In these the whole question turns on persons and facts. An indefinite question is always the\nmore comprehensive, since it is from the indefinite\nquestion that the definite is derived. I will illustrate\nwhat I mean by an example. The question is indefinite; the question is definite, and consequently may be\nregarded as a subject for a deliberative theme. But\neven those which have no connexion with particular\npersons are generally given a specific reference.\nFor instance the question is abstract,\nwhereas has a\nspecific reference. But in this latter case we may\nsay that a person is tacitly implied. For the\nmention of a tyrant doubles the question, and\nthere is an implicit admission of time and quality;\nbut all the same you would scarcely be justified in\ncalling it a cause or definite question. Those questions which I have styled indefinite are also called\ngeneral if this is correct, we shall have to call definite\nquestions special questions. But in every special\nquestion the general question is implicit, since the\ngenus is logically prior to the species. And perhaps\neven in actual causes wherever the notion of quality\ncomes into question, there is a certain intrusion of the abstract. Does not\nthis raise the general question as to whether we\nhave the right to kill a man who lies in wait for us\nWhat again of conjectures May not they be of a\ngeneral character, as for instance, or or As for definitions, everything that they contain is undoubtedly of a general\nnature. There are some who hold that even those\nquestions which have reference to persons and particular cases may at times be called theses, provided\nonly they are put slightly differently for instance,\nif Orestes be accused, we shall have a cause whereas\nif it is put as question, namely it will be a thesis. To the same class\nas this last belongs the question These persons distinguish a thesis from a cause as follows a\nthesis is theoretical in character, while a cause has\nrelation to actual facts, since in the former case we\nargue merely with a view to abstract truth, while in\nthe latter we have to deal with some particular act. Some, however, think that general questions are\nuseless to an orator, since no profit is to be derived\nfrom proving that we ought to marry or to take\npart in politics, if we are prevented from so doing\nby age or ill health. But not all general questions\nare liable to this kind of objection. For instance\nquestions such as or cannot\nbe countered in this way. Further in questions which have reference to a particular person, although\nit is not sufficient merely to handle the general\nquestion, we cannot arrive at any conclusion on\nthe special point until we have first discussed the\ngeneral question. For how is Cato to deliberate unless the\ngeneral question is first settled And how is he to deliberate unless it is\nproved that it is the duty of Cato to marry There\nare, however, certain books attributed to Hermagoras which support this erroneous opinion, though\nwhether the attribution is spurious or whether they\nwere written by another Hermagoras is an open\nquestion. For they cannot possibly be by the\nfamous Hermagoras, who wrote so much that was\nadmirable on the art of rhetoric, since, as is clear\nfrom the first book of the Rhetorica of Cicero, he\ndivided the material of rhetoric into theses and causes.\nCicero objects to this division, contends that theses\nhave nothing to do with an orator, and refers all\nthis class of questions to the philosophers. But\nCicero has relieved me of any feeling of shame\nthat I might have in controverting his opinion, since\nhe has not only expressed his disapproval of his Rhetorica, but in the Orator, the de Oratore and the\nTopica instructs us to abstract such discussions\nfrom particular persons and occasions, In all general\nquestions, however, the essential basis is the same as\nin a cause or definite question. It is further\npointed out that there are some questions which concern while others have\na particular reference; an example of the former\nwill be the question of the\nlatter ; or again the\nquestion whether a man is brave will illustrate the\nfirst, while the question whether he is braver than\nanother will exemplify the second. Apollodorus defines a cause in the following terms\nI quote the translation of his pupil Valgius or again He then defines a matter in the following terms\n A matter is a combination of persons, circumstances\nof place and time, motives, means, incidents, acts,\ninstruments, speeches, the letter and the spirit of the\nlaw. Let us then understand a cause in the sense of\nthe Greek hypothesis or subject, and a matter in the\nsense of the Greek peristasis or collection of circumstances. But some, however, have defined a cause in\nthe same way that Apollodorus defines a matter.\nIsocrates on the other hand defines a cause as some\ndefinite question concerned with some point of civil affairs,\nor a dispute in which definite persons are involved; while\nCicero uses the following words VI. Since every cause, then, has a certain essential\nbasis on which it rests, before I proceed to set forth\nhow each kind of cause should be handled, I think I should first examine a question that is common to all\nof them, namely, what is meant by basis, whence it\nis derived and how many and of what nature such\nbases may be. Some, it is true, have thought that\nthey were peculiar merely to forensic themes, but\ntheir ignorance will stand revealed when I have\ntreated of all three kinds of oratory. That which I\ncall the basis some style the constitution, others the\nquestion, and others again that which may be inferred\nfrom the question, while Theodorus calls it the most general head, to which everything\nmust be referred. These different names, however, all\nmean the same thing, nor is it of the least importance\nto students by what special name things are called,\nas long as the thing itself is perfectly clear. The\nGreeks call this essential basis a name which\nthey hold was not invented by Hermagoras, but\naccording to some was introduced by Naucrates, the\npupil of Isocrates, according to others by Zopyrus of\nClazomenae, although Aeschines in his speech against\nCtesiphon seems to employ the word, when he asks\nthe jury not to allow Demosthenes to be irrelevant\nbut to keep him to the stasis or basis of the case. The term seems to be derived from the fact that it\nis on it that the first collision between the parties to\nthe dispute takes place, or that it forms the basis or\nstanding of the whole case. So much for the origin of\nthe name. Now for its nature. Some have defined\nthe basis as being the first conflict of the causes. The\nidea is correct, but the expression is faulty. For the\nessential basis is not the first conflict, which we may\nrepresent by the clauses and It is rather the\nkind of question which arises from the first conflict, which we may represent as follows. or It is clear\nfrom these examples, that the first sort of question\ndepends on conjecture, the second on definition, and\nthat the contending parties rest their respective cases\non these points the bases of these questions will\ntherefore be of a conjectural or definitive character\nrespectively. Suppose it should be asserted that\nsound is the conflict between two bodies, the statement would in my opinion be erroneous. For sound\nis not the actual conflict, but a result of the conflict.\nThe error is, however, of small importance for the\nsense is clear, whatever the expression. But this\ntrivial mistake has given rise to a very serious error\nin the minds of those who have not understood what\nwas meant for on reading that the essential basis was\nthe first conflict, they immediately concluded that the\nbasis was always to be taken from the first question,\nwhich is a grave mistake. For every question has\nits basis, since every question is based on assertion by\none party and denial by another. But there are some\nquestions which form an essential part of causes, and\nit is on these that we have to express an opinion;\nwhile others are introduced from without and are,\nstrictly speaking, irrelevant, although they may\ncontribute something of a subsidiary nature to the\ngeneral contention. It is for this reason that there\nare said to be several questions in one matter of\ndispute. Of these questions it is often the most\ntrivial which occupies the first place. For it is a\nfrequent artifice to drop those points in which we\nplace least confidence, as soon as we have dealt with\nthem; sometimes we make a free gift of them to our opponents, while sometimes we are content to use\nthem as a step to arguments which are of greater\nimportance. A simple cause, however, although it\nmay be defended in various ways, cannot have more\nthan one point on which a decision has to be given,\nand consequently the basis of the cause will be that\npoint which the orator sees to be the most important\nfor him to make and on which the judge sees that he\nmust fix all his attention. For it is on this that the\ncause will stand or fall. On the other hand questions\nmay have more bases than one. A brief example\nwill show what I mean. When the accused says he\nmakes the basis one of quality; but when he adds he introduces an element of\nconjecture. But denial of the facts is always the\nstronger line of defence, and therefore I conceive the\nbasis to reside in that which I should say, if I were\nconfined to one single line of argument. We are\nright therefore in speaking of the first conflict of\ncauses in contradistinction to the conflict of questions.\nFor instance in the first portion of his speech on\nbehalf of Rabirius Postumus Cicero contends that the\naction cannot lie against a Roman knight, while in\nthe second he asserts that no money ever came into\nhis client's hands. Still I should say that the basis\nwas to be found in the latter as being the stronger of\nthe two. Again in the case of Milo I do not consider\nthat the conflict is raised by the opening questions, but\nonly when the orator devotes all his powers to prove that\nClodius lay in wait for Milo and was therefore rightly\nkilled. The point on which above all the orator must\nmake up his mind, even although he may be going to take up various lines of argument in support of his\ncase, is this what is it that he wishes most to impress\nupon the mind of the judge But although this\nshould be the first point for his consideration, it does\nnot follow that it should be the first that he will make\nin his actual speech. Others have thought that the basis lay in the first\npoint raised by the other side in its defence. Cicero\nexpresses this view in the following words This involves\na further question as to whether the basis can only be\ndetermined by the defence. Cornelius Celsus is\nstrongly against this view, and asserts that the basis\nis derived not from the denial of the charge, but from\nhim who affirms his proposition. Thus if the accused\ndenies that anyone has been killed, the basis will\noriginate with the accuser, because it is the latter\nwho desires to prove if on the other hand the\naccused asserts that the homicide was justifiable, the\nburden of proof has been transferred and the basis\nwill proceed from the accused and be affirmed by him.\nI do not, however, agree. For the contrary is nearer\nto the truth, that there is no point of dispute if the\ndefendant makes no reply, and that consequently the\nbasis originates with the defendant. But in my\nopinion the origin of the basis varies and depends on\nthe circumstances of the individual case. For instance\nin conjectural causes the affirmation may be regarded\nas determining the basis, since conjecture is employed\nby the plaintiff rather than the defendant, and consequently some have styled the basis originated\nby the latter negative. Again in any syllogism\nthe whole of the reasoning proceeds from him who affirms. But on the other hand he who in such cases\ndenies appears to impose the burden of dealing with\nsuch bases upon his opponent. For if he says he will force his opponent to make use of con-\njecture, and again, if he says he will force him to employ the syllogism. Therefore\nwe must admit that a basis can originate in denial.\nAll the same we are left with our previous conclusion\nthat the basis is determined in some cases by the\nplaintiff, in some by the defendant. Suppose the\naccuser to affirm that the accused is guilty of homicide if the accused denies the charge, it is he who\nwill determine the basis. Or again, if he admits that\nhe has killed a man, but states that the victim was\nan adulterer and justifiably killed and we know that\nthe law permits homicide under these circumstances,\nthere is no matter in dispute, unless the accuser has\nsome answer to make. Suppose the accuser does\nanswer however and deny that the victim was guilty\nof adultery, it will be the accuser that denies, and it\nis by him that the basis is determined. The basis,\nthen, will originate in the first denial of facts, but\nthat denial is made by the accuser and not the\naccused. Again the same question may make the\nsame person either accuser or accused. An individual who had performed before the praetor in his private gardens, but\nhad never been presented on the public stage, has\ntaken his seat in one of the fourteen rows. The\naccuser of course affirms that he has exercised the\nprofession of an actor the accused denies that he has\nexercised the profession. The question then arises as to the meaning of the If he is accused under the law regarding\nthe seats in the theatre, the denial will proceed from\nthe accused; if on the other hand he is turned out\nof the theatre and demands compensation for assault,\nthe denial will be made by the accuser. The view\nof the majority of writers on this subject will,\nhowever, hold good in most cases. Some have evaded\nthese problems by saying that a basis is that which\nemerges from affirmations and denials, such as or But let us see whether this is the basis\nitself or rather that in which the basis is to be found.\nHermagoras calls a basis that which enables the\nmatter in question to be understood and to which the\nproofs of the parties concerned will also be directed.\nMy own opinion has always been that, whereas there\nare frequently different bases of questions in connexion\nwith a cause, the basis of the cause itself is its most\nimportant point on which the whole matter turns.\nIf anyone prefers to call that the general question or\ngeneral head of the cause, I shall not quarrel with him,\nany more than I have done hitherto if he produced\na different technical term to express the same thing,\nalthough I know that whole volumes have been\nwritten on such disputes. I prefer however to call\nit the basis. There is the greatest possible disagreement among writers about this as about everything\nelse, but in this case as elsewhere they seem to me to\nhave been misled by a passion for saying something\ndifferent from their fellow-teachers. As a result\nthere is still no agreement as to the number and\nnames of bases, nor as to which are general and which\nspecial. To begin with Aristotle lays down that there are\nten categories on which every question seems to turn. First there is which Plautus calls essence, the\nonly available translation under this category we inquire whether a thing is. Secondly there is quality,\nthe meaning of which is self-evident. Third comes\nquantity, which was subdivided by later philosophers\nas dealing with two questions as to magnitude and\nnumber. Next relation, involving questions of competence and comparison. This is followed by when\nand where. Then come doing, suffering and possessing, which for example are concerned with a person's being\narmed or clothed. Lastly comes or position,\nwhich means to be in a certain position, such for instance as being warm, standing or angry. Of these\ncategories the first four concern bases, the remainder\nconcern only certain topics for argument. Others\nmake the number of categories to be nine. Person,\ninvolving questions concerning the mind, body or\nexternal circumstances, which clearly has reference\nto the means by which we establish conjecture or\nquality. Time, or from which we get questions\nsuch as whether a child is born a slave, if his mother\nis delivered of him while assigned to her creditors.\nPlace, from which we get such disputes as to whether\nit is permissible to kill a tyrant in a temple, or\nwhether one who has hidden himself at home can be\nregarded as an exile. Then comes time in another\nsense, called by the Greeks, by which they\nrefer to a period of time, such as summer or winter; under this heading come problems such as that about\nthe man who held high revel in a time of pestilence.\nAction or to which they refer questions as to\nwhether an act was committed wittingly or unwittingly, by accident or under compulsion and the like.\nNumber, which falls under the category of quantity,\nunder which come questions such as whether the\nstate owes Thrasybulus thirty talents for ridding it of\nthe same number of tyrants. Cause, under which\nheading come a large number of disputes, whenever\na fact is not denied, but the defence pleads that the\nact was just and reasonable. or manner, which\nis involved when a thing is said to have been done in\none way when it might have been done in another\nunder this category come cases of such as that of the\nadulterer who is scourged with thongs or starved to\ndeath. Opportunity for action, the meaning of which\nis too obvious to need explanation or illustration\nthe Greeks however call it These\nauthorities like Aristotle hold that no question can\narise which does not come under one of these heads.\nSome subtract two of them, namely number and opportunity, and substitute for what I have called action,\nthings, or in Greek I have thought it sufficient to notice these doctrines, for fear someone might\ncomplain of their omission. Still I do not consider\nthat bases are sufficiently determined by these categories, nor that the latter cover every possible kind\nof topic, as will be clear to any that read carefully\nwhat I have to say on both points. For there will be\nfound to be many topics that are not covered by\nthese categories. I find it stated in many authors that some rhetoricians only recognise one kind of basis, the con- jectural. But they have not mentioned who these\nrhetoricians are nor have I been able to discover.\nThey are however stated to have taken this view on\nthe ground that all our knowledge is a matter of\ninference from indications. On this line of reasoning they might regard all bases as qualitative, because\nwe inquire into the nature of the subject in every\ncase. But the adoption of either view leads to inextricable confusion. Nor does it matter whether one\nrecognises only one kind of basis or none at all, if\nall causes are of the same nature. Coniectura is derived from conicere because it\nimplies the concentration of the reason on the truth.\nFor this reason interpreters of dreams and all other\nphenomena are called coniectores But\nthe conjectural basis has received more names than\none, as will appear in the sequel. Some have recognised only two bases. Archedemus for instance admits only the conjectural and\ndefinitive and refuses to admit the qualitative, since\nhe held that questions of quality take the form of which he terms questions about identity and\ndifference. A different view was held by those who\nlikewise only admitted two bases, but made them\nthe negative and juridical. The negative basis is\nidentical with that which we call the conjectural, to\nwhich some give the name of negative absolutely,\nothers only in part, these latter holding that conjecture is employed by the accuser, denial only by the\naccused. The juridical is that known in Greek as But just as Archedemus would not\nrecognise the qualitative basis, so these reject the\ndefinitive which they include in the juridical, holding that in these questions we have to enquire whether\nit is just that the act with which the accused is\ncharged should be called sacrilege or theft or madness. Pamplihlus held this opinion but subdivided\nquality into several different species. The majority\nof later writers have classified bases as follows, involving however no more than a change of names\nthose dealing with ascertained facts and those\ndealing with matters where there is a doubt. For\na thing must either be certain or uncertain if\nit is uncertain, the basis will be conjectural; if\ncertain, it will be some one of the other bases. Apollodorus says the same thing when he states that\na question must either lie in things external, which give\nplay to conjecture, or in our own opinions the former\nhe calls the latter The same\nis said by those who employ the terms and that is to say doubtful and presumptive, by this latter term meaning those facts which\nare beyond a doubt. Theodorus agrees with them,\nfor he holds that the question is either as to whether\nsuch and such a thing is really so, or is concerned\nwith the accidents of something which is an admitted\nfact that is to say it is either or For in all these cases the first\nbasis is conjectural, while the second belongs to one\nof the other classes. As for these other classes of\nbasis, Apollodorus holds that there are two, one concerned with quality and the other with the names of\nthings, that is to say a definitive basis. Theodorus\nmakes them four, concerned with existence, quality,\nquantity and relation. There are some too who make\nquestions of identity and difference come under the\nhead of quality, others who place it under the head of definition. Posidonius divides them into two\nclasses, those concerned with words and those concerned with things. In the first case he thinks that\nthe question is whether a word has any meaning; if\nso, what is its meaning, how many meanings has it,\nand how does it come to mean what it means In\nthe latter case, we employ conjecture, which he calls or inference from perception, quality,\ndefinition which he calls or rational inference, and relation. Hence also comes the division\ninto things written and unwritten. Even Cornelius\nCelsus stated that there were two general bases, one\nconcerned with the question whether a thing is, the\nother with the question of what kind it is. He included definition under the first of these, because\nenquiry may equally be made as to whether sacrilege\nhas been committed, when a man denies that he\nhas stolen anything from a temple, and when he\nadmits that he has stolen private money from a\ntemple. He divides quality into fact and the letter\nof the law. Under the head of the letter of the law he\nplaces four classes, excluding questions of competence quantity and intention he places under the\nhead of conjecture. There is also another method of\ndividing bases into two classes according to this\ndisputes are either about substance or quality, while\nquality is treated either in its most general sense or\nin its special senses. Substance is dealt with by conjecture for in enquiring into anything, we ask\nwhether it has been done, is being done, or is likely\nto be done, and sometimes also consider its intention\nthis method is preferable to that adopted by those\nwho style the conjectural basis a basis of fact, as\nthough we only enquired into the past and what has actually been done. The consideration of quality\nunder its most general aspect rarely comes up in\nthe courts; I refer to questions such as With\nregard to the special aspects of quality, questions\nsometimes occur about some common term, such as\nwhether sacrilege has been committed when a man\nhas stolen private money from a temple, or about\nsome act with a definite name, when there is no\ndoubt either as to the commission or the nature of\nthe act. Under this heading come all questions\nabout what is honourable, just or expedient. These\nbases are said to contain others as well, because\nquantity is sometimes concerned with conjectural bases,\nas in the question whether the sun is bigger than\nthe earth, and sometimes with qualitative bases, as in\nthe question what reward or punishment it would\nbe just to assign to some particular person, while\nquestions of competence undoubtedly are concerned\nwith quality, and definition with questions of competence. ratiocinative\nbasis or syllogism and the majority of questions dealing with the letter of the law and intention are based\non equity, with the exception that this last question\nsometimes admits of conjecture as, for instance, concerning the intentions of the legislator ambiguity,\nhowever, must always be explained by conjecture,\nbecause as it is clear that the words admit of two\ninterpretations the only question is as to the\nintention. A large number of writers recognise general bases;\nCicero adopts them in his Orator, and holds that\neverything that can form the subject of dispute or\ndiscussion is covered by the three questions, whether it is, what it is, and of what kind it is. The names\nof these three bases are too obvious for mention.\nThe same view is asserted by Patrocles. Marcus\nAntonius stated that there were three bases\nin the following words But since,\nwhen we are said to have been justified in doing\nanything, this does not merely mean that our action\nwas legal, but further implies that it was just, those\nwho follow Antonius attempt to differentiate these\nbases with greater exactness. They therefore called\nthem conjectural, legal and juridical, a division which\nmeets with the approval of Verginius as well. These\nthey then subdivided into species, placing definition\nunder the head of the legal basis, together with all\nothers which are concerned with the letter of the law\nsuch as that of contradictory laws, or that\nwhich rests on the letter of the law and on meaning\nor intention which the Greeks call and to which latter we give various\nnames, styling it the translative, transumptive or transpositive basis; the syllogism, which we call the\nratiocinative or deductive basis; and those which turn\non ambiguity or I mention these because\nthey are called bases by most writers, though some\nprefer to call them legal questions. Athenaeus laid down that there were four bases\nthe or that is, the\nhortative, which is peculiar to deliberative themes;\nthe which is shown to be the conjectural, not\nso much from the name itself, but from what follows; the or definitive, for it consists\nin a change of terms.; and the juridical to which\nhe gives the name employed by other Greek writers. For, as I have said, there is a great variety in the\nnames employed. There are some who, arguing from\nits meaning of change, hold that is the\ntranslative basis, which is concerned with competence.\nOthers, Caecilius and Theon for instance, hold\nthat there are the same number of bases, but make\nthem of a different kind, namely, those covered by\nthe questions whether a thing is, what it is, of what\nkind it is and how great it is. Aristotle in his\nRhetoric states that all enquiry turns on the questions whether a thing is, of what kind it is, how great\nit is, and of how many parts it consists. In one\nplace however he recognises the force of definition\nas well, saying that certain points are defended\non the following lines Cicero again in his Rhetorica makes the\nnumber of bases to be four, namely those concerned\nwith fact, names, kinds, and legal action, that is to say\nconjecture is concerned with fact, definition with\nnames, quality with kinds, and law with action\nunder this latter head of law he included questions of competence. But in another passage he\ntreats legal questions as a species of action. Some writers have held that there are five bases the conjectural, definitive, qualitative, quantitative and\nrelative. Theodorus, also, as I have said, adopts the\nsame number of general heads, whether a thing is, what\nit is, of what kind it is, how great it is, and to what it refers.\nThe last he considers to be chiefly concerned with\ncomparison, since better and worse, greater and less are meaningless terms unless referred to some\nstandard. But questions of relation, as I have already\npointed out, enter also into translative questions, that\nis, questions of competence, since in cases such as or For all these questions must be referred\nto a certain standard. Others hold that there are\nsix bases conjecture or quality, particularity or by which word they mean definition, quantity\nor comparison and competence, for which a new\nterm has been found in I call it new\nwhen applied to a basis, for Hermagoras employs it\nto describe a species of juridical question. Others\nthink there are seven, while refusing to recognise\ncompetence, quantity or comparison, in place of which\nthey substitute four legal bases, completing the\nseven by the addition of those three which they call\nrational. Others again make eight by the addition\nof competence to the above-mentioned seven. Some\non the other hand have introduced a fresh method\nof division, reserving the name of bases for the\nrational, and giving the name of questions to the legal,\nas I mentioned above, since in the former the\nproblem is concerned with facts, in the latter with\nthe letter of the law. Some on the contrary reverse\nthis nomenclature calling the legal questions bases\nand the rational grounds questions. But others have\nthought that there are only three rational bases,\ncovered by the questions whether a thing is, what it is,\nand of what kind it is Hermagoras is alone in\nthinking that there are four, namely conjecture, particularity, competence, and quality to the latter he appends the phrase illustrating his meaning by putting a\ncase where it is enquired whether a man happen to\nbe good or bad. He then subdivides quality into\nfour species first that which is concerned with\nthings to he sought or avoided, which belongs to deliberative oratory secondly those concerned with\npersons, by which he indicates panegyric thirdly the\npractical or pragmatic, which is concerned with things\nin general without reference to persons, and may be\nillustrated by questions such as whether he is free\nwho is claimed as a slave and waiting the trial of his\ncase, whether riches beget insolence, and whether a\nthing is just or good; lastly there is the juridical\nspecies, under which practically the same questions\narise, but in relation to certain definite persons, as for\ninstance when it is asked whether that particular man\nhas done well or ill. I am aware that another explanation is given by Cicero in the first book of his\nRhetorica of the species known as practical,\nwhere he says that it is But I have\nalready mentioned what his opinion was about this\nparticular work. The Rhetorica are simply a collection of school-notes on rhetoric which he worked\nup into this treatise while quite a young man. Such\nfaults as they possess are due to his instructor. In the\npresent instance he may have been influenced by the\nfact that the first examples given by Hermagoras of\nthis species are drawn from legal questions, or by the\nfact that the Greeks call interpreters of the law But for these early efforts Cicero substituted his splendid de Oratore and therefore cannot be\nblamed for giving false instruction. I will now\nreturn to Hermagoras. He was the first rhetorician\nto teach that there was a basis concerned with competence, although the elements of this doctrine are\nfound in Aristotle, without however any mention of\nthe name. The legal questions were according to\nHermagoras of five kinds. First the letter of the\nlaw and its intention; the names which he gives to\nthese are and that is to say\nthe letter of the law and the exceptions thereto the\nfirst of these classes is found in all writers, but the\nterm exception is less in use. The number is\ncompleted by the ratiocinative basis and those\ndealing with ambiguity and contradictory laws. Albutius\nadopts this classification, but eliminates competence,\nincluding it under the juridical basis. Further he\nholds that in legal questions there is no ratiocinative\nbasis. I know that those who are prepared to\nread ancient writers on rhetoric more carefully than\nI have, will be able to discover yet more on this\nsubject, but I fear that I may have been too lengthy\neven in saying what I have said. I must admit that I am now inclined to take a\ndifferent view from that which I once held. It would\nperhaps be safer for my reputation if I were to make\nno modification in views which I not only held for so\nmany years, but of which I expressed my open approbation. But I cannot bear to be thought guilty of\nconcealment of the truth as regards any portion of\nmy views, more especially in a work designed for the\nprofit of young men of sound disposition. For Hippocrates, the great physician, in my opinion took the\nmost honourable course in acknowledging some of his errors to prevent those who came after from\nbeing led astray, while Cicero had no hesitation about\ncondemning some of his earlier works in books which\nhe published later I refer to his condemnation of\nhis Lucullus and Catulus and the books on rhetoric\nwhich I have already mentioned. Indeed we should\nhave no justification for protracting our studies if we\nwere forbidden to improve upon our original views.\nStill none of my past teaching was superfluous for\nthe views which I am now going to produce will be\nfound to be based on the same principles, and consequently no one need be sorry to have attended my\nlectures, since all that I am now attempting to do is to\ncollect and rearrange my original views so that they\nmay be somewhat more instructive. But I wish to\nsatisfy everybody and not to lay myself open to the\naccusation that I have allowed a long time to elapse\nbetween the formation and publication of my views. I used to follow the majority of authorities in adhering to three rational bases, the conjectural, qualitative and definitive, and to one legal basis. These were\nmy general bases. The legal basis I divided into five\nspecies, dealing with the letter of the law and intention,\ncontradictory laws, the syllogism, ambiguity and competence. It is now clear to me that the fourth of the\ngeneral bases may be removed, since the original\ndivision which I made into rational and legal bases is\nsufficient. The fourth therefore will not be a basis,\nbut a kind of question; if it were not, it would form\none of the rational bases. Further I have removed\ncompetence from those which I called species. For I\noften asserted, as all who have attended my lectures\nwill remember, and even those discourses which\nwere published against my will included the statement, that the basis concerned with competence\nhardly ever occurs in any dispute under such circumstances that it cannot more correctly be given some\nother name, and that consequently some rhetoricians\nexclude it from their list of bases. I am, however,\nwell aware that the point of competence is raised in\nmany cases, since in practically every case in which\na party is said to have been ruled out of court through\nsome error of form, questions such as the following\narise whether it was lawful for this person to bring\nan action, or to bring it against some particular\nperson, or under a given law, or in such a court, or\nat such a time, and so on But the question of competence as regards persons, times, legal actions and\nthe rest originates in some pre-existent cause\nthe question turns therefore not on competence\nitself, but on the cause with which the point of\ncompetence originates. The question then arises\nwhether the sum is too large, and the dispute is one of fact. It then has to be\ndecided whether he could have been so appointed. The point\nin doubt is whether the interdict is legal. All these\npoints fall under the head of legal questions. not even those special pleas, in which questions of\ncompetence make themselves most evident, give rise to\nthe same species of question as those laws under\nwhich the action is brought, so that the enquiry is really concerned with the name of a given act, with\nthe letter of the law and its meaning, or with something that requires to be settled by argument The\nbasis originates from the question, and in cases of\ncompetence it is not the question concerning which\nthe advocate argues that is involved, but the question\non account of which he argues. An example will make\nthis clearer. The question is whether he has killed him;\nthe basis is the conjectural. But the following case is\nvery different. The question is whether he\nhas the right, and it is from this that we derive the basis.\nFor whether he is allowed the right or not depends\non the event, not on the cause itself, and on the decision of the judge, not on that on account of which\nhe gives such a decision. The following is a similar\nexample. The judge will decide whether he should be\npunished, but it is not with this that the question or\nthe basis is concerned. Where then does the question\nlie The question is\nwhether he killed him. Does this involve a\nbasis I think not. Here\nthere is a question and a basis as well. So, too, involves no basis. Where then is it to be found In this case the\nquestion is whether he has been so deprived, or\nwhether loss of civil rights debars a person from bringing an action. Here on the other hand we find\nboth questions and bases. It is therefore to kinds of\ncauses, not to bases that the term competence applies\nother kinds of cause are the comparative and the recriminatory. it is urged, I do not deny\nit, but this does not make it a basis. For these statements are not propositions until the reasons for them\nare added. If they were propositions as they stand,\nthe case could not proceed. The question\nis whether this was a justifiable reason, and the basis\nis one of quality. So too as regards competence. The question here is what is legal\naction. And we shall arrive at the conclusion that the\nson's disinheritance is unlawful, by use of the syllogism.\nThe case will be similar with all the rational and legal\nbases. I am aware that there have been some who\nplaced competence among rational bases, using as\nillustrations cases such as, That is to say\nit was not due to me, but some external cause. From\nthese writers I differ even more widely for it is not\nthe nature of the legal action itself which is involved\nin the question of competence, but the cause of the act; and this is the case in almost every defence. Finally\nhe who adopts this line of defence, does not thereby\nabandon the qualitative basis; for he states that he himself is free from blame, so that we really should\ndifferentiate between two kinds of quality one of\nwhich comes into play when both the accused person\nand his act are defended, and the other when the\naccused person alone is defended. We must therefore accept the view of the authorities followed by Cicero, to the effect that there are\nthree things on which enquiry is made in every case\nwe ask whether a thing is, that it is, and of that kind it\nis. Nature herself imposes this upon us. For first of all\nthere must be some subject for the question, since we\ncannot possibly determine what a thing is, or of what\nkind it is, until we have first ascertained whether it is,\nand therefore the first question raised is whether it is.\nBut even when it is clear that a thing is, it is not\nimmediately obvious what it is. And when we have\ndecided what it is, there remains the question of its\nquality. These three points once ascertained, there\nis no further question to ask. These heads cover both\ndefinite and indefinite questions. One or more of them\nis discussed in every demonstrative, deliberative or\nforensic theme. These heads again cover all cases in\nthe courts, whether we regard them from the point\nof view of rational or legal questions. For no legal\nproblem can be settled save by the aid of definition,\nquality and conjecture. Those, however, who are\nengaged in instructing the ignorant will find it useful\nat first to adopt a slightly less rigid method the road\nwill not be absolutely straight to begin with, but it\nwill be more open and will provide easier going. I\nwould have them therefore learn above all things that there are four different methods which may be\nemployed in every case, and he who is going to plead\nshould study them as first essentials. For, to begin\nwith the defendant, far the strongest method of self-defence is, if possible, to deny the charge. The\nsecond best is when it is possible to reply that the\nparticular act with which you are charged was never\ncommitted. The third and most honourable is to\nmaintain that the act was justifiable. If none of\nthese lines of defence are feasible, there remains the\nlast and only hope of safety if it is impossible either\nto deny the charge or justify the act, we must evade\nthe charge with the aid of some point of law, making\nit appear that the action has been brought against us\nillegally Hence arise those questions of legal action\nor competence. For there are some things, which,\nalthough not laudable in themselves, are yet permitted by law; witness the passage in the Twelve Tables\nauthorising creditors to divide up a debtor's body\namongst themselves, a law which is repudiated by\npublic custom. There are also certain things which\nalthough equitable are prohibited by law; witness the\nrestrictions placed on testamentary disposition. The\naccuser likewise has four things which he must keep\nin mind he must prove that something was done,\nthat a particular act was done, that it was wrongly\ndone, and that he brings his charge according to law.\nThus every cause will turn on the same sorts of\nquestions, though the parts of plaintiff and defendant\nwill sometimes be interchanged for instance in the\ncase of a claim for a reward, it will be the plaintiffs\ntask to show that what was done was right. These four schemes or forms of action which I then\ncalled general bases fall into two classes as I have shown, namely, the rational and the legal. The\nrational is the simpler, as it involves nothing more\nthan the consideration of the nature of things. In\nthis connection, therefore, a mere mention of conjeclure, definition and quality will suffice. Legal questions\nnecessarily have a larger number of species, since\nthere are many laws and a variety of forms. In the\ncase of one law we rely on the letter, in others on the\nspirit. Some laws we force to serve our turn, when\nwe can find no law to support our case, others we\ncompare with one another, and on others we put some\nnovel interpretation. Thus from these three bases we\nget three resemblances of bases sometimes simple,\nsometimes complex, but all having a character of their\nown, as, for instance, when questions of the letter of\nthe law and its intention are involved, for these clearly\ncome under conjecture or quality; or again where the\nsyllogism is involved, for this is specially connected\nwith quality; or where contradictory laws are involved,\nfor these are on the same footing as the letter of the\nlaw and intention; or yet again in cases of ambiguity,\nwhich is always resolved by conjecture. Definition also\nbelongs to both classes of question, namely those\nconcerned with the consideration of facts and those\nconcerned with the letter of the law. All these\nquestions, although they come under the three bases,\nyet since, as I have mentioned, they have certain\ncharacteristic features of their own, require to be\npointed out to learners; and we must allow them\nto be called legal bases or questions or minor heads, as\nlong as it is clearly understood that none of them\ninvolve any other questions than the three I have\nmentioned. As regards questions of quantity, number,\nrelation, and, as some have thought, comparison, the case is different. For these have no connexion with\nthe complexities of the law, but are concerned with\nreason only. Consequently they must always be\nregarded as coming under conjecture or quality, as, for\ninstance, when we ask with what purpose, or at what\ntime, or place something was done. But I will speak of individual questions when I\ncome to handle the rules for division. This much is\nagreed to by all writers, that one cause possesses one\nbasis, but that as regards secondary questions related\nto the main issue of the trial, there may frequently\nbe a number in one single cause. I also think there\nis at times some doubt as to which basis should be\nadopted, when many different lines of defence are\nbrought to meet a single charge; and, just as in regard to the complexion to be given to the statement\nof the facts of the case, that complexion is said to be\nthe best which the speaker can best maintain, so in\nthe present connexion I may say that the best basis\nto choose is that which will permit the orator to develop a maximum of force. It is for this reason that\nwe find Cicero and Brutus taking up different lines\nin defence of Milo. Cicero says that Clodius was\njustifiably killed because he sought to waylay Milo,\nbut that Milo had not designed to kill him; while\nBrutus, who wrote his speech merely as a rhetorical\nexercise, also exults that Milo has killed a bad citizen. In complicated causes, however, two or three bases may\nbe found, or different bases for instance a man may\nplead that he did not do one thing, and that he was\njustified in doing another, or to take another similar\nclass of case, a man may deny two of the charges. The same thing occurs when there is a question\nabout some one thing which is claimed by a number of persons, who may all of them rely on the same\nkind of plea for instance, on the right of the next of\nkin, or may put in different claims, one urging that\nthe property was left him by will, another that he is\nnext of kin. Now whenever a different defence has\nto be made against different claimants, there must be\ndifferent bases, as for example the well-known controversial theme Nothbus is the Greek word for a bastard;\nLatin, as Cato emphasized in one of his speeches, has\nno word of its own and therefore borrows the foreign\nterm. But I am straying from the point. The son\nwho was made heir by the will finds his way barred\nby the law The basis is one resting on\nthe letter of the law and intention, and the problem is\nwhether he can inherit by any means at all can he\ndo so in accordance with the intention of his father\nor in virtue of the fact that he was made heir by the\nwill The problem confronting the bastard is twofold, since he was born after the two legitimate sons and was not born before a legitimate son. The first\nproblem involves a syllogism are those sons who\nhave been cast out from their own family to be regarded as though they had never been born The\nsecond is concerned with the letter of the law and\nintention. For it is admitted that he was not born\nbefore any legitimate son, but he will defend his\nclaim by appealing to the intention of the law, which\nhe will maintain to imply that the bastard, born when\nthere was no legitimate son in the family, should\nrank as legitimate. He will dismiss the letter of the\nlaw, pointing out that in any case the position of a\nbastard is not prejudiced by the fact that no legitimate\nson was born after him, and arguing as follows It need disturb no one\nthat one law should originate two bases. The law is\ntwofold, and therefore has the force of two laws.\nTo the son who desires to re-enter the family, the\ndisinherited's first reply is, The basis will be the same as in the claim put forward\nby the disinherited son, since the question at issue is\nwhether a disinherited son can inherit. Both the\ndisinherited and the bastard will object, But in this connexion each will rely on\nhis own particular question. For the disinherited son\nwill say that even a disinherited man does not cease to be a son, and will derive an argument from that\nvery law which denies his claim to the inheritance;\nnamely that it was unnecessary for a disinherited son\nto be excluded from possession of his father's property\nif he had ceased to be one of the family; but now,\nsince in virtue of his rights as son he would have\nbeen his father's heir if he had died intestate, the\nlaw is brought to bar his claim; and yet the law does\nnot deprive him of his position as son, but only of his\nposition as heir. Here the basis is definitive, as turning\non the definition of a son. Again the bastard in his\nturn will urge that his father did not die childless,\nemploying the same arguments that he had used in\nputting forward his claim that he ranked as a son;\nunless indeed he too has recourse to definition, and\nraises the question whether even bastards are not sons.\nThus in one case we shall have either two special\nlegal bases, namely the letter of the law and intention,\nwith the syllogism and also definition, or those three\nwhich are really the only bases strictly so called, conjecture as regards the letter of the law and intention,\nquality in the syllogism, and definition, which needs no\nexplanation. Further every kind of case will contain a cause, a\npoint for the decision of the judge, and a central argument.\nFor nothing can be said which does not contain a\nreason, something to which the decision of the judge\nis directed, and finally something which, more than\naught else, contains the substance of the matter at\nissue. But as these vary in different cases and are as\na rule explained by writers on judicial causes, I will\npostpone them to the appropriate portion of my work.\nFor the present I shall follow the order which I\nprescribed by my division of causes into three classes. VII. I will begin with the class of causes which are\nconcerned with praise and blame. This class appears\nto have been entirely divorced by Aristotle, and\nfollowing him by Theophrastus, from the practical\nside of oratory which they call  and to\nhave been reserved solely for the delectation of\naudiences, which indeed is shown to be its peculiar\nfunction by its name, which implies display. Roman\nusage on the other hand has given it a place in the\npractical tasks of life. For funeral orations are\noften imposed as a duty on persons holding public\noffice, or entrusted to magistrates by decree of the\nsenate. Again the award of praise or blame to a\nwitness may carry weight in the courts, while it is\nalso a recognised practice to produce persons to\npraise the character of the accused. Further the\npublished speeches of Cicero directed against his\nrivals in the election to the consulship, and\nagainst Lucius Piso, Clodius and Curio, are full of\ndenunciation, and were notwithstanding delivered in\nthe senate as formal expressions of opinion in the\ncourse of debate. I do not deny that some compositions of this kind are composed solely with a view\nto display, as, for instance, panegyrics of gods and\nheroes of the past, a consideration which provides\nthe solution of a question which I discussed a little\nwhile back, and proves that those are wrong who\nhold that an orator will never speak on a subject\nunless it involves some problem. But what problem\nis involved by the praise of Jupiter Capitolinus, a\nstock theme of the sacred Capitoline contest, which\nis undoubtedly treated in regular rhetorical form However, just as panegyric applied to practical\nmatters requires proof, so too a certain semblance of\nproof is at times required by speeches composed\nentirely for display. For instance, a speaker who tells\nhow Romulus was the son of Mars and reared by the\nshe-wolf, will offer as proofs of his divine origin the\nfacts that when thrown into a running stream he\nescaped drowning, that all his achievements were such\nas to make it credible that he was the offspring of the\ngod of battles, and that his contemporaries unquestionably believed that he was translated to heaven. Some arguments will even wear a certain semblance\nof defence for example, if the orator is speaking\nin praise of Hercules, he will find excuses for his\nhero having changed raiment with the Queen of\nLydia and submitted to the tasks which legend tells\nus she imposed upon him. The proper function\nhowever of panegyric is to amplify and embellish its\nthemes. This form of oratory is directed in the main to\nthe praise of gods and men, but may occasionally be\napplied to the praise of animals or even of inanimate objects. In praising the gods our first step\nwill be to express our veneration of the majesty of\ntheir nature in general terms. next we shall proceed\nto praise the special power of the individual god and\nthe discoveries whereby he has benefited the human\nrace. For example, in the case of Jupiter, we shall\nextol his power as manifested in the governance of\nall things, with Mars we shall praise his power in war,\nwith Neptune his power over the sea; as regards\ninventions we shall celebrate Minerva's discovery of\nthe arts, Mercury's discovery of letters, Apollo's of\nmedicine, Ceres' of the fruits of the earth, Bacchus' of wine. Next we must record their exploits as\nhanded down from antiquity. Even gods may derive honour from their descent, as for instance is\nthe case with the sons of Jupiter, or from their\nantiquity, as in the case of the children of Chaos, or\nfrom their offspring, as in the case of Latona, the\nmother of Apollo and Diana. Some again may be\npraised because they were born immortal, others\nbecause they won immortality by their valour, a theme\nwhich the piety of our sovereign has made the glory\neven of these present times. There is greater variety required in the praise of\nmen. In the first place there is a distinction to be\nmade as regards time between the period in which\nthe objects of our praise lived and the time preceding their birth; and further, in the case of the\ndead, we must also distinguish the period following\ntheir death. With regard to things preceding a\nman's birth, there are his country, his parents and his\nancestors, a theme which may be handled in two\nways. For either it will be creditable to the objects of\nour praise not to have fallen short of the fair fame of\ntheir country and of their sires or to have ennobled\na humble origin by the glory of their achievements. Other topics to be drawn from the period preceding\ntheir birth will have reference to omens or prophecies foretelling their future greatness, such as the\noracle which is said to have foretold that the son of\nThetis would be greater than his father. of the individual himself will be based on his\ncharacter, his physical endowments and external\ncircumstances. Physical and accidental advantages\nprovide a comparatively unimportant theme, which\nrequires variety of treatment. At times for instance we extol beauty and strength in honorific terms, as\nHomer does in the case of Agamemnon and\nAchilles; at times again weakness may contribute\nlargely to our admiration, as when Homer says that\nTydeus was small of stature but a good fighter. Fortune too may confer dignity as in the case of\nkings and princes for they have a fairer field for\nthe display of their excellences but on the other\nhand the glory of good deeds may be enhanced by\nthe smallness of their resources. Moreover the\npraise awarded to external and accidental advantages\nis given, not to their possession, but to their honourable employment. For wealth and power and influence, since they are the sources of strength, are the\nsurest test of character for good or evil; they make us\nbetter or they make us worse. Praise awarded to\ncharacter is always just, but may be given in various\nways. It has sometimes proved the more effective\ncourse to trace a man's life and deeds in due chronological order, praising his natural gifts as a child, then\nhis progress at school, and finally the whole course of\nhis life, including words as well as deeds. At times\non the other hand it is well to divide our praises,\ndealing separately with the various virtues, fortitude, justice, self-control and the rest of them and\nto assign to each virtue the deeds performed under\nits influence. We shall have to decide which of\nthese two methods will be the more serviceable,\naccording to the nature of the subject; but we\nmust bear in mind the fact that what most pleases\nan audience is the celebration of deeds which our\nhero was the first or only man or at any rate one of\nthe very few to perform and to these we must add\nany other achievements which surpassed hope or expectation, emphasising what was done for the sake\nof others rather than what he performed on his\nown behalf. It is not always possible to deal with\nthe time subsequent to our hero's death this is\ndue not merely to the fact that we sometimes praise\nhim, while still alive, but also that there are but few\noccasions when we have a chance to celebrate the\naward of divine honours, posthumous votes of thanks,\nor statues erected at the public expense. Among\nsuch themes of panegyric I would mention monuments of genius that have stood the test of time.\nFor some great men like Menander have received\nampler justice from the verdict of posterity than\nfrom that of their own age. Children reflect glory\non their parents, cities on their founders, laws on\nthose who made them, arts on their inventors and\ninstitutions on those that first introduced them; for\ninstance Numa first laid down rules for the worship\nof the gods, and Publicola first ordered that the\nlictors' rods should be lowered in salutation to the\npeople. The same method will be applied to denunciations\nas well, but with a view to opposite effects. For humble\norigin has been a reproach to many, while in some\ncases distinction has merely served to increase the\nnotoriety and unpopularity of vices. In regard to\nsome persons, as in the story of Paris, it has been\npredicted that they would be the cause of destruction\nto many, some like Thersites and Irus have been\ndespised for their poverty and mean appearance,\nothers have been loathed because their natural advantages were nullified by their vices the poets for\ninstance tell us that Nireus was a coward and\nPleisthenes a debauchee. The mind too has as many vices as virtues, and vice may be denounced,\nas virtue may be praised, in two different ways.\nSome have been branded with infamy after death\nlike Maelius, whose house was levelled with the\nground, or Marcus Manlius, whose first name was\nbanished from his family for all generations to\ncome. The vices of the children bring hatred on\ntheir parents; founders of cities are detested for\nconcentrating a race which is a curse to others, as\nfor example the founder of the Jewish superstition; the laws of Gracchus are hated, and we\nabhor any loathsome example of vice that has been\nhanded down to posterity, such as the criminal form of\nlust which a Persian is said to have been the first to\npractise on a woman of Samos. And even in the\ncase of the living the judgment of mankind serves\nas a proof of their character, and the fairness or\nfoulness of their fame proves the orator's praise or\nblame to be true. Aristotle however thinks that the place and subject of panegyrics or denunciations make a very considerable difference. For much depends on the\ncharacter of the audience and the generally received\nopinion, if they are to believe that the virtues of\nwhich they approve are pre-eminently characteristic\nof the person praised and the vices which they hate\nof the person denounced. For there can be\nlittle doubt as to the attitude of the audience,\nif that attitude is already determined prior to\nthe delivery of the speech. It will be wise\ntoo for him to insert some words of praise for\nhis audience, since this will secure their good\nwill, and wherever it is possible this should be done\nin such a manner as to advance his case. Literature will win less praise at Sparta than at Athens, endurance and courage more. Among some races the life\nof a freebooter is accounted honourable, while others\nregard it as a duty to respect the laws. Frugality\nmight perhaps be unpopular with the Sybarites,\nwhilst luxury was regarded as a crime by the ancient Romans. Similar differences of opinion are\nfound in individuals. A judge is most favourable to\nthe orator whose views he thinks identical with his\nown. Aristotle also urges a point, which at a later\ndate Cornelius Celsus emphasised almost to excess,\nto the effect that, since the boundary between vice\nand virtue is often ill-defined, it is desirable to use\nwords that swerve a little from the actual truth,\ncalling a rash man brave, a prodigal generous, a mean\nman thrifty; or the process may, if necessary, be reversed. But this the ideal orator, that is to say a\ngood man, will never do, unless perhaps he is led to\ndo so by consideration for the public interest. Cities are praised after the same fashion as men.\nThe founder takes the place of the parent, and antiquity carries great authority, as for instance in the\ncase of those whose inhabitants are said to be sprung\nfrom the soil. The virtues and vices revealed by\ntheir deeds are the same as in private individuals.\nThe advantages arising from site or fortifications are\nhowever peculiar to cities. Their citizens enhance\ntheir fame just as children bring honour to their\nparents. Praise too may be awarded to public works,\nin connexion with which their magnificence,\nutility, beauty and the architect or artist must\nbe given due consideration. Temples for instance\nwill be praised for their magnificence, walls for their utility, and both for their beauty or the skill of\nthe architect. Places may also be praised, witness\nthe praise of Sicily in Cicero. In such cases\nwe consider their beauty and utility beauty calls for\nnotice in places by the sea, in open plains and\npleasant situations, utility in healthy or fertile\nlocalities. Again praise in general terms may be\nawarded to noble sayings or deeds. Finally things\nof every kind may be praised. Panegyrics have\nbeen composed on sleep and death, and physicians\nhave written eulogies on certain kinds of food. While therefore I do not agree that panegyric\nconcerns only questions regarding what is honourable, I do think that it comes as a rule under\nthe heading of quality, although all three bases may\nhe involved in Panegyric and it was observed by\nCicero that all were actually used by Gaius Caesar\nin his denunciation of Cato. But panegyric is akin\nto deliberative oratory inasmuch as the same things\nare usually praised in the former as are advised\nin the latter. VIII. I am surprised that deliberative oratory also\nhas been restricted by some authorities to questions\nof expediency. If it should be necessary to assign\none single aim to deliberative I should prefer\nCicero's view that this kind of oratory is primarily\nconcerned with what is honourable. I do not doubt\nthat those who maintain the opinion first mentioned\nadopt the lofty view that nothing can be expedient\nwhich is not good. That opinion is perfectly sound\nso long as we are fortunate enough to have wise and\ngood men for counsellors. But as we most often\nexpress our views before an ignorant audience, and\nmore especially before popular assemblies, of which the majority is usually uneducated, we must distinguish between what is honourable and what is expedient and conform our utterances to suit ordinary\nunderstandings. For there are many who do not\nadmit that what they really believe to be the honourable course is sufficiently advantageous, and are\nmisled by the prospect of advantage into approving\ncourses of the dishonourable nature of which there\ncan be no question witness the Numantine treaty\nand the surrender of the Caudine Forks. Nor does\nit suffice to restrict deliberative oratory to the basis\nof quality which is concerned with questions of\nhonour and expediency. For there is often room\nfor conjecture as well. Sometimes again definition\nis necessary or legal problems require handling; this\nis especially the case when advice has to be given\non private matters, where there is some doubt of\nthe legality of the course under consideration. Of\nconjecture' I shall speak more fully a little later\non. Returning to definition for the moment, we\nfind it in the question raised by Demosthenes, and to that discussed by Cicero in the Philippics as\nto the nature of a tumultus. Again does not the\nquestion raised in connection with the statue of\nServius Sulpicius as to bear a strong resemblance to\nthe questions that are raised in the law courts The\ndeliberative department of oratory also called the advisory department, while it deliberates about the\nfuture, also enquires about the past, while its functions are twofold and consist in advising and\ndissuading. Deliberative oratory does not always require an\nexordium, such as is necessary in forensic speeches,\nsince he who asks an orator for his opinion is naturally\nwell disposed to him. But the commencement, whatever be its nature, must have some resemblance to an\nexordium. For we must not begin abruptly or just at\nthe point where the fancy takes us, since in every\nsubject there is something which naturally comes first. In addressing the senate or the people the same\nmethods apply as in the law courts, and we must aim\nas a rule at acquiring the goodwill of our audience.\nThis need cause no surprise, since even in panegyric\nwe seek to win the favour of our hearers when our\naim is praise pure and simple, and not the acquisition\nof any advantage. Aristotle, it is true, holds, not\nwithout reason, that in deliberative speeches we may\noften begin with a reference either to ourselves or to\nour opponent, borrowing this practice from forensic\noratory, and sometimes producing the impression that\nthe subject is of greater or less importance than it\nactually is. On the other hand he thinks that in\ndemonstrative oratory the exordium may be treated with\nthe utmost freedom, since it is sometimes drawn from\nirrelevant material, as for example in Isocrates' Praise\nof Helen, or from something akin to the subject,\nas for instance in the Panegyricus of the same author,\nwhen he complains that more honour is given to physical than to moral excellence, or as Gorgias in his\nspeech delivered at the Olympic games praises the\nfounders of the great national games. Sallust seems to have imitated these authors in his Jugurthine War\nand in the introduction to his Catiline, which has no\nconnection with his narrative. But it is time for me to return to deliberative oratory\nin which, even when we introduce an exordium, we\nmust content ourselves with a brief prelude, which\nmay amount to no more than a mere heading. As\nregards the statement of facts, this is never required in\nspeeches on private subjects, at least as regards the\nsubject on which an opinion has to be given, because\neveryone is acquainted with the question at issue. Statements as to external matters which are relevant\nto the discussion may however frequently be introduced. In addressing public assemblies it will often\nbe necessary to set forth the order of the points\nwhich have to be treated. As regards appeals to the\nemotions, these are especially necessary in deliberative\noratory. Anger has frequently to be excited or\nassuaged and the minds of the audience have to be\nswayed to fear, ambition, hatred, reconciliation. At\ntimes again it is necessary to awaken pity, whether it\nis required, for instance, to urge that relief should be\nsent to a besieged city, or we are engaged in deploring the overthrow of an allied state. But what really\ncarries greatest weight in deliberative speeches is the\nauthority of the speaker. For he, who would have\nall men trust his judgment as to what is expedient\nand honourable, should both possess and be regarded as possessing genuine wisdom and excellence\nof character. In forensic speeches the orator may,\naccording to the generally received opinion, indulge\nhis passion to some extent. But all will agree that\nthe advice given by a speaker should be in keeping\nwith his moral character. The majority of Greek writers have held that this\nkind of oratory is entirely concerned with addressing\npublic assemblies and have restricted it to politics. Even Cicero himself deals chiefly with this department. Consequently those who propose to offer advice\nupon peace, war, troops, public works or revenue must\nthoroughly acquaint themselves with two things, the\nresources of the state and the character of its people,\nso that the method employed in tendering their advice may be based at once on political realities and\nthe nature of their hearers. This type of oratory\nseems to me to offer a more varied field for eloquence,\nsince both those who ask for advice and the answers\ngiven to them may easily present the greatest diversity. Consequently there are three points which must\nbe specially borne in mind in advice or dissuasion\nfirst the nature of the subject under discussion,\nsecondly the nature of those who are engaged in the\ndiscussion, and thirdly the nature of the speaker who\noffers them advice. As to the subject under discussion\nits practicability is either certain or uncertain. In\nthe latter case this will be the chief, if not\nthe only point for consideration; for it will often\nhappen that we shall assert first that something\nought not to be done, even if it can be done, and\nsecondly, that it cannot be done. Now when\nthe question turns on such points as to whether the\nIsthmus can be cut through, the Pontine Marshes\ndrained, or a harbour constructed at Ostia, or whether\nAlexander is likely to find land beyond the Ocean,\nwe make use of conjecture. But even in connection\nwith things that are undoubtedly feasible, there may\nat times be room for conjecture, as for instance in\nquestions such as whether Rome is ever likely to conquer Carthage, whether Hannibal will return to\nAfrica if Scipio transports his army thither, or whether\nthe Samnites are likely to keep faith if the Romans\nlay down their arms. There are some things too\nwhich we may believe to be both feasible and likely\nto be carried into effect, but at another time or place\nor in another way. When there is no scope for conjecture, our attention will be fixed on other points. In the first place\nadvice will be asked either on account of the actual\nthing on which the orator is required to express his\nviews, or on account of other causes which affect it\nfrom without. It is on the actual thing that the\nsenate for instance debates, when it discusses such\nquestions as whether it is to vote pay for the troops.\nIn this case the material is simple. To this however\nmay be added reasons for taking action or the reverse,\nas for example if the senate should discuss whether\nit should deliver the Fabii to the Gauls when the\nlatter threaten war, or Gaius Caesar should deliberate\nwhether he should persist in the invasion of Germany,\nwhen his soldiers on all sides are making their wills.\nThese deliberative themes are of a twofold nature. In the first case the reason for deliberation is the\nGallic threat of war, but there may still be a further\nquestion as to whether even without such threat of\nwar they should surrender those who, contrary to the\nlaw of nations, took part in a battle when they had\nbeen sent out as ambassadors and killed the king\nwith whom they had received instructions to treat. In the second case Caesar would doubtless never deliberate on the question at all, but for the perturbation\nshown by his soldiers; but there is still room for\nenquiry whether quite apart from this occurrence it would be wise to penetrate into Germany. But it\nmust be remembered that we shall always speak first\non that subject which is capable of discussion quite\napart from the consequences. Some have held that the three main considerations\nin an advisory speech are honour, expediency and\nnecessity. I can find no place for the last. For however great the violence which may threaten us, it may\nbe necessary for us to suffer something, but we are not\ncompelled to do anything; whereas the subject of\ndeliberation is primarily whether we shall do anything. Or if by necessity they mean that into which we are\ndriven by fear of worse things, the question will be one\nof expediency. For example, if a garrison is besieged\nby overwhelmingly superior forces and, owing to the\nfailure of food and water supplies, discusses surrender\nto the enemy, and it is urged that it is a matter of\nnecessity, the words must\nneeds be added consequently there is no necessity\narising out of the circumstances themselves, for death\nis a possible alternative. And as a matter of fact the\nSaguntines did not surrender, nor did those who were\nsurrounded on the raft from Opitergium. It follows\nthat in such cases also the question will be either one\nof expediency alone or of a choice between expediency and honour. it will be urged, Certainly. But he who wishes to\nbecome a father must needs be quite clear that he\nmust take a wife. It appears to me, therefore, that\nwhere necessity exists, there is no room for deliberation, any more than where it is clear that a thing is not feasible. For deliberation is always concerned\nwith questions where some doubt exists. Those\ntherefore are wiser who make the third consideration\nfor deliberative oratory to be or as we translate it; the translation may seem clumsy,\nbut it is the only word available. That all these\nconsiderations need not necessarily obtrude themselves in every case is too obvious to need explanation.\nMost writers, however, say that there are more than\nthree. But the further considerations which they\nwould add are really but species of the three general\nconsiderations just mentioned. For right, justice,\npiety, equity and mercy for thus they translate , with any other virtues that anyone may be\npleased to add, all come under the heading of that\nwhich is honourable. On the other hand, if the question\nbe whether a thing is easy, great, pleasant or free from\ndanger, it comes under questions of expediency. Such\ntopics arise from some contradiction; for example a\nthing is expedient, but difficult, or trivial, or unpleasant, or dangerous. Some however hold that at\ntimes deliberation is concerned solely with the question\nwhether a thing is pleasant, as for instance when discussion arises as to whether a theatre should be built or\ngames instituted. But in my opinion you will never\nfind any man such a slave to luxury as not to consider\nanything but pleasure when he delivers an advisory\nspeech. For there must needs be something on every\noccasion that takes precedence of pleasure in proposing the institution of public games there is the honour\ndue to the gods; in proposing the erection of a\ntheatre the orator will consider the advantages to be\nderived from relaxation from toil, and the unbecoming\nand undesirable struggle for places which will arise if there is no proper accommodation; religion, too, has\nits place in the discussion, for we shall describe the\ntheatre as a kind of temple for the solemnization of a\nsacred feast. Often again we shall urge that honour\nmust come before expediency; as for instance when\nwe advise the men of Opitergium not to surrender to\nthe enemy, even though refusal to do so means\ncertain death. At times on the other hand we prefer\nexpediency to honour, as when we advise the arming\nof slaves in the Punic War. But even in this case we\nmust not openly admit that such a course is dishonourable we can point out that all men are free by\nnature and composed of the same elements, while\nthe slaves in question may perhaps be sprung\nfrom some ancient and noble stock; and in the\nformer case when the danger is so evident,\nwe may add other arguments, such as that they\nwould perish even more cruelly if they surrendered,\nshould the enemy fail to keep faith, or Caesar a\nmore probable supposition prove victorious. But\nin such a conflict of principles it is usual to modify\nthe names which we give them. For expediency is\noften ruled out by those who assert not merely that\nhonour comes before expediency, but that nothing\ncan be expedient that is not honourable, while others\nsay that what we call honour is vanity, ambition and\nfolly, as contemptible in substance as it is fair in\nsound. Nor is expediency compared merely with\ninexpediency. At times we have to choose between\ntwo advantageous courses after comparison of their\nrespective advantages. The problem may be still\nmore complicated, as for instance when Pompey\ndeliberated whether to go to Parthia, Africa or\nEgypt. In such a case the enquiry is not which of two courses is better or worse, but which of three or\nmore. On the other hand in deliberative oratory there\nwill never be any doubt about circumstances wholly\nin our favour. For there can clearly be no doubt about\npoints against which there is nothing to be said.\nConsequently as a rule all deliberative speeches are\nbased simply on comparison, and we must consider\nwhat we shall gain and by what means, that it may be\npossible to form an estimate whether there is more\nadvantage in the aims we pursue or greater disadvantage in the means we employ to that end. A\nquestion of expediency may also be concerned with\ntime for example, \nor with place  or\nwith particular persons  or  or with our method of\naction  or with\ndegree . But we have still more often to consider personality with reference to what is becoming, and we\nmust consider our own as well as that of those\nbefore whom the question is laid. Consequently,\nthough examples are of the greatest value in\ndeliberative speeches, because reference to historical parallels is the quickest method of securing assent, it matters a great deal whose authority\nis adduced and to whom it is commended. For\nthe minds of those who deliberate on any subject differ from one another and our audience may\nbe of two kinds. For those who ask us for advice are either single individuals or a number, and\nin both cases the factors may be different. For\nwhen advice is asked by a number of persons it\nmakes a considerable difference whether they are the senate or the people, the citizens of Rome or\nFidenae, Greeks or barbarians, and in the case of\nsingle individuals, whether we are urging Cato or\nGaius Marius to stand for office, whether it is the\nelder Scipio or Fabius who is deliberating on his plan\nof campaign. Further sex, rank, and age, must be\ntaken into account, though it is character that will\nmake the chief difference. It is an easy task to\nrecommend an honourable course to honourable\nmen, but if we are attempting to keep men of bad\ncharacter to the paths of virtue, we must take care\nnot to seem to upbraid a way of life unlike our own. The minds of such an audience are not to be moved\nby discoursing on the nature of virtue, which they\nignore, but by praise, by appeals to popular opinion,\nand if such vanities are of no avail, by demonstration\nof the advantage that will accrue from such a policy,\nor more effectively perhaps by pointing out the\nappalling consequences that will follow the opposite\npolicy. For quite apart from the fact that the minds\nof unprincipled men are easily swayed by terror, I\nam not sure that most men's minds are not more\neasily influenced by fear of evil than by hope of\ngood, for they find it easier to understand what is\nevil than what is good. Sometimes again we urge\ngood men to adopt a somewhat unseemly course,\nwhile we advise men of poor character to take a\ncourse in which the object is the advantage of\nthose who seek our advice. I realise the thought\nthat will immediately occur to my reader Cicero might clear me from blame in the\nmatter; for he writes to Brutus in the following\nterms, after setting forth a number of things that might honourably be urged on Caesar However, this is a\nsomewhat abstruse question, and does not concern\ndeliberative oratory alone. I shall therefore reserve\nit for my twelfth and concluding book. For my part\nI would not have anything done dishonourably. But\nfor the meantime let us regard these questions as at\nleast belonging to the rhetorical exercises of the\nschools for knowledge of evil is necessary to enable\nus the better to defend what is right. For the\npresent I will only say that if anyone is going to urge\na dishonourable course on honourable man, he\nshould remember not to urge it as being dishonourable, and should avoid the practice of certain declaimers who urge Sextus Pompeius to piracy just\nbecause it is dishonourable and cruel. Even when we\naddress bad men, we should gloss over what is unsightly. For there is no man so evil as to wish to\nseem so. Thus Sallust makes Catiline speak as one\nwho is driven to crime not by wickedness but by indignation, and Varius makes Atreus say How much more has this pretence of honour to be\nkept up by those who have a real regard for their\nown good name Therefore when we advise Cicero\nto beg Antonius for mercy or even to burn the\nPhilippics if Antonius promises to spare him on that\ncondition, we shall not empliasise the love of life in\nour advice for if that passion has any force with him, it will have it none the less if we are silent,\nbut we shall exhort him to save himself in the interest of the state. For he needs some such reason\nas that to preserve him from feeling shame at entreating such a one as Antony. Again if we urge\nGaius Caesar to accept the crown we shall assert\nthat the state is doomed to destruction unless controlled by a monarchy. For the sole aim of the man\nwho is deliberating about committing a criminal act\nis to make his act appear as little wicked as possible. It also makes a great deal of difference who it is\nthat is offering the advice for if his past has been\nillustrious, or if his distinguished birth or age or\nfortune excite high expectations, care must be taken\nthat his words are not unworthy of him. If on the\nother hand he has none of these advantages he will\nhave to adopt a humbler tone. For what is regarded\nas liberty in some is called licence in others. Some\nreceive sufficient support from their personal\nauthority, while others find that the force of reason\nitself is scarce sufficient to enable them to maintain\ntheir position. Consequently I regard impersonation as the most\ndifficult of tasks, imposed as it is in addition to the\nother work involved by a deliberative theme. For\nthe same speaker has on one occasion to impersonate\nCaesar, on another Cicero or Cato. But it is a most\nuseful exercise because it demands a double effort\nand is also of the greatest use to future poets and\nhistorians, while for orators of course it is absolutely\nnecessary. For there are many speeches composed\nby Greek and Latin orators for others to deliver, the\nwords of which had to be adapted to suit the position and character of those for whom they were written. Do you suppose that Cicero thought in the\nsame way or assumed the same character when he\nwrote for Gnaeus Pompeius and when he wrote for\nTitus Ampius and the rest Did he not rather bear\nin mind the fortune, rank and achievements of each\nsingle individual and represent the character of all\nto whom he gave a voice so that though they spoke\nbetter than they could by nature, they still might\nseem to speak in their own persons For a speech\nwhich is out of keeping with the man who delivers\nit is just as faulty as the speech which fails to suit\nthe subject to which it should conform. It is for\nthis reason that Lysias is regarded as having shown\nthe highest art in the speeches which he wrote for\nuneducated persons, on account of their extraordinary realism. In the case of declaimers indeed it is\nof the first importance that they should consider\nwhat best suits each character for they rarely play\nthe role of advocates in their declamations. As a\nrule they impersonate sons, parents, rich men, old\nmen, gentle or harsh of temper, misers, superstitious persons, cowards and mockers, so that hardly\neven comic actors have to assume more numerous\nroles in their performances on the stage than\nthese in their declamations. All these rles may\nbe regarded as forming part of impersonation,\nwhich I have included under delibertive themes,\nfrom which it differs merely in that it involves the\nassumption of a role. It is sometimes introduced\neven with controversial themes, which are drawn\nfrom history and involve the appearance of definite\nhistorical characters as pleaders. I am aware also\nthat historical and poetical themes are often set for\nthe sake of practice, such as Priam's speech to Achilles or Sulla's address to the people on his\nresignation of the dictatorship. But these will fall\nunder one or other of the three classes into which\nI have divided causes. For entreaty, statement,\nand argument, with other themes already mentioned,\nare all of frequent occurrence in forensic, deliberative\nor demonstrative subjects, according as circumstances\ndemand, and we often introduce fictitious speeches\nof historical persons, whom we select ourselves.\nCicero for instance in the pro Caelio makes both\nAppius Caecus and her brother Clodius address\nClodia, the former rebuking her for her immorality,\nthe latter exhorting her thereto. In scholastic declamations the fictitious themes for\ndeliberative speeches are often not unlike those of\ncontroversial speeches and are a compromise between\nthe two forms, as for instance when the theme set is\na discussion in the presence of Gaius Caesar of the\npunishment to be meted out to Theodotus; for it consists of accusation and defence, both of them peculiar\nto forensic oratory. But the topic of expediency also\nenters into the case, in such questions as whether it\nwas to Caesar's advantage that Pompeius should be\nslain; whether the execution of Theodotus would\ninvolve the risk of a war with the king of Egypt;\nwhether such a war would be highly inopportune at\nsuch a critical moment, would prove dangerous and\nbe certain to last a long time. There is also a question\nof honour. Does it befit Caesar to avenge Pompeius'\ndeath or is it to be feared that an admission that\nPompeius did not deserve death will injure the cause\nof the Caesarian party It may be noted that discussions of such a kind may well occur in actual\ncases. Declaimers have however often been guilty of an\nerror as regards deliberative themes which has involved a series of consequences. They have considered deliberative themes to be different and\nabsolutely opposed to forensic themes. For they have\nalways affected abrupt openings, an impetuous style\nand a generous embellishment, as they call it, in their\nlanguage, and have been especially careful to make\nshorter notes for deliberative than for forensic themes. For my part while I realise that deliberative themes\ndo not require an exordium, for reasons which I have\nalready stated, I do not, however, understand why\nthey should open in such a wild and exclamatory\nmanner. When a man is asked to express his opinion\non any subject, he does not, if he is sane, begin to\nshriek, but endeavours as far as possible to win the\nassent of the man who is considering the question by\na courteous and natural opening. Why, I ask, in review of the fact that deliberations require moderation\nabove all else, should the speaker on such themes indulge in a torrential style of eloquence kept at one\nhigh level of violence I acknowledge that in controversial speeches the tone is often lowered in the\nexordium, the statement of facts and the argument, and\nthat if you subtract these three portions, the remainder is more or less of the deliberative type of\nspeech, but what remains must likewise be of a more\neven flow, avoiding all violence and fury. With\nregard to manificence of language, deliblerative declaimers should avoid straining after it more than\nothers, but it comes to them more naturally. For\nthere is a preference among those who invent such\nthemes for selecting great personages, such as kings,\nprinces, senators and peoples, while the theme itself is generally on a grander scale. Consequently since\nthe words are suited to the theme, they acquire\nadditional splendour from the magnificence of the\nmatter. In actual deliberations the case is different,\nand consequently Theophrastus laid it down that in\nthe deliberative class of oratory the language should\nas far as possible be free from all affectation in\nstating this view he followed the authority of his instructor, although as a rule he is not afraid to differ\nfrom him. For Aristotle held that the demonstrative\ntype of oratory was the best suited for writing and\nthat the next best was forensic oratory his reason for\nthis view was that the first type is entirely concerned\nwith display, while the second requires art, which\nwill even be employed to deceive the audience, if\nexpedience should so demand, whereas advice requires\nonly truth and prudence. I agree with this view as\nregards demonstrative oratory in fact all writers are\nagreed on this point, but as regards forensic and deliberative themes I think that the style must be suited to\nthe requirements of the subject which has to be treated. For I notice that the Philippics of Demosthenes\nare pre-eminent for the same merits as his forensic\nspeeches, and that the opinions expressed by Cicero\nbefore the senate or the people are as remarkable for\nthe splendour of their eloquence as the speeches\nwhich he delivered in accusing or defending persons\nbefore the courts. And yet Cicero says of deliberative oratory that the whole speech should be simple\nand dignified, and should derive its ornament rather\nfrom the sentiments expressed than the actual words. As regards the use of examples practically all authorities are with good reason agreed that there is no\nsubject to which they are better suited, since as a rule history seems to repeat itself and the experience\nof the past is a valuable support to reason. Brevity\nand copiousness are determined not so much by the\nnature as by the compass of the subject. For, just as\nin deliberations the question is generally less complicated, so in forensic cases it is often of less\nimportance. Anyone who is content to read not merely speeches,\nbut history as well, in preference to growing grey over\nthe notebooks of the rhetoricians, will realise the\ntruth of what I say for in the historians the speeches\ndelivered to the people and the opinions expressed\nin the senate often provide examples of advice and\ndissuasion. he will find an avoidance of abrupt\nopenings in deliberatire speeches and will note that\nthe forensic style is often the more impetuous of the\ntwo, while in both cases the words are suited to the\nmatter and forensic speeches are often shorter than\ndeliberative. Nor will he find in them those faults into\nwhich some of our declaimers fall, namely a coarse\nabuse of those who hold opposite opinions and a\ngeneral tendency to speak in such a way as to make\nit seem that the speaker's views are in opposition to\nthose of the persons who ask his advice. Consequently\ntheir aim seems to be invective rather than persuasion. I would have my younger readers realise that these\nwords are penned for their special benefit that they\nmay not desire to adopt a different style in their\nexercises from that in which they will be required to\nspeak, and may not be hampered by having to unlearn what they have acquired. For the rest if they\nare ever summoned to take part in the counsels of\ntheir friends, or to speak their opinions in the senate,\nor advise the emperor on some point on which he may consult them, they will learn from practice\nwhat they cannot perhaps put to the credit of the\nschools. IX. I now come to the forensic kind of oratory,\nwhich presents the utmost variety, but whose duties\nare no more than two, the bringing and rebutting\nof charges. Most authorities divide the forensic\nspeech into five parts the exordium, the statement of\nfacts, the proof, the refutation, and the peroration.\nTo these some have added the partition into heads,\nproposition and digression, the two first of which\nform part of the proof. For it is obviously\nnecessary to propound what you are going to prove\nas well as to conclude. Why then, if proposition is a\npart of a speech, should not conclusion be also Partition on the other hand is merely one aspect of\narrangement, and arrangement is a part of rhetoric\nitself, and is equally distributed through every theme\nof oratory and their whole body, just as are invention\nand style. Consequently we must regard partition\nnot as one part of a whole speech, but as a part of\neach individual question that may be involved. For\nwhat question is there in which an orator cannot\nset forth the order in which he is going to make\nhis points And this of course is the function of partition. But how ridiculous it is to make each question an aspect of proof, but partition which is an\naspect of a question a part of the whole speech. As\nfor digression egressio, now more usually styled\nexcessus, if it lie outside the case, it cannot be part\nof it, while, if it lie within it, it is merely an accessory or ornament of that portion of the case from\nwhich digression is made. For if anything that lies\nwithin the case is to be called part of it, why not call argument, comparison, commonplace, pathos, illustration parts of the case On the other hand I\ndisagree with those who, like Aristotle, would remove refuation from the list on the ground that it\nforms part of the proof for the proof is constructive, and the reputation destructive. Aristotle also\nintroduces another slight novelty in making proposition, not statement of facts, follow the exordium. This\nhowever he does because he regards proposition as\nthe genus and statement of facts as the species, with\nthe result that he holds that, whereas the former is\nalways and everywhere necessary, the latter may\nsometimes be dispensed with. It is however necessary to point out as regards\nthese five parts which I have established, that that\nwhich has to be spoken first is not necessarily that\nwhich requires our first consideration. But above\nall we must consider the nature of the case,\nthe question at issue and the arguments for and\nagainst. Next we must consider what points are\nto be made, and what refuted, and then how the\nfacts are to be stated. For the stalement of facts is\ndesigned to prepare the way for the proofs and must\nneeds be unprofitable, unless we have first determined what proofs. are to be promised in the statement. Finally we must consider how best to win the\njudge to take our view. For we cannot be sure until\nwe have subjected all the parts of the case to careful\nscrutiny, what sort of impression we wish to make\nupon the judge are we to mollify him or increase\nhis severity, to excite or relax his interest in the\ncase, to render him susceptible to influence or the\nreverse I cannot however approve the view of those who think that the exordium should actually be written last.\nFor though we must collect all our material and determine the proper place for each portion of it, before\nwe begin to speak or write, we must commence with\nwhat naturally comes first. No one begins a portrait\nby painting or modelling the feet, and no art finds its\ncompletion at the point where it should begin.\nOtherwise what will happen if we have not time to\nwrite our speech Will not the result of such a\nreversal of the proper order of things be that we\nshall be caught napping We must therefore review the subject-matter in the order laid down, but\nwrite our speech in the order in which we shall\ndeliver it. X. Every cause in which one side attacks and the\nother defends consists either of one or more controversial questions. In the first case it is called simple,\nin the second complex. An example of the first is\nwhen the subject of enquiry is a theft or an adultery\ntaken by itself. In complex cases the several questions may all be of the same kind, as in cases of\nextortion, or of different kinds, as when a man is\naccused at one and the same time of homicide and\nsacrilege. Such cases no longer arise in the public\ncourts, since the praetor allots the different charges\nto different courts in accordance with a definite rule;\nbut they still are of frequent occurrence in the\nImperial or Senatorial courts, and were frequent in\nthe days when they came up for trial before the\npeople. Private suits again are often tried by one\njudge, who may have to determine many different\npoints of law. There are no other species of forensic\ncauses, not even when one person brings the same\nsuit on the same grounds against two different persons, or two persons bring the same suit against\none, or several against several, as occasionally occurs\nin lawsuits about inheritances. Because although a\nnumber of parties may be involved, there is still only\none suit, unless indeed the different circumstances\nof the various parties alter the questions at issue. There is however said to be a third and different\nclass, the comparative. Questions of comparison frequently require to be handled in portions of a cause,\nas for instance in the centum viral court, when after\nother questions have been raised the question is discussed as to which of two claimants is the more deserving of an inheritance. It is rare however for a\ncase to be brought into court on such grounds alone,\nas in divinations which take place to determine who\nthe accuser shall be, and occasionally when two informers dispute as to which has earned the reward. Some again have added a fourth class, namely\nmutual accusation, which they call Others, however, regard it as belonging to the comparative group, to which indeed the common case of\nreciprocal suits on different grounds bears a strong\nresemblance. If this latter case should also be called for it has no special name of its own, we\nmust divide mutual accusation into two classes, in one\nof which the parties bring the same charge against\neach other, while in the other they bring different\ncharges. The same division will also apply to claims. As soon as we are clear as to the kind of cause on\nwhich we are engaged, we must then consider\nwhether the act that forms the basis of the charge\nis denied or defended, or given another name or\nexcepted from that class of action. Thus we determine the basis of each case. XI. As soon as these points are ascertained, the\nnext step, according to Hermagoras, should be to\nconsider what is the question at issue, the line of defence,\nthe point for the judge's decision and the central point,\nor, as others call it, the foundation of the case. The\nquestion in its more general sense is taken to mean\neverything on which two or more plausible opinions\nmay be advanced. In forensic subjects however it\nmust be taken in two senses first in the sense in\nwhich we say that a controversial matter involves\nmany questions, thereby including all minor questions; secondly in the sense of the main question on\nwhich the case turns. It is of this, with which the\nbasis originates, that I am now speaking. We ask\nwhether a thing has been done, what it is that has\nbeen done, and whether it was rightly done. To these Hermagoras and Apollodorus and many other\nwriters have given the special name of questions;\nTheodorus on the other hand, as I have already said,\ncalls them general heads, while he designates minor\nquestions or questions dependent on these general\nheads as special heads. For it is agreed that question\nmay spring from question, and species be subdivided\ninto other species. This main question, then, they\ncall the The line of defence is the method by\nwhich an admitted act is defended. I see no reason\nwhy I should not use the same example to illustrate\nthis point that has been used by practically all my\npredecessors. Orestes has killed his mother the\nfact is admitted. He pleads that he was justified in\nso doing the basis will be one of quality, the\nquestion, whether he was justified in his action, the\nline of defence that Clytemnestra killed her husband,\nOrestes' father. This is called the or motive. The point for the decision of the judge is known as\nthe and in this case is whether it was\nright that even a guilty mother should be killed by\nher son. Some have drawn a distinction between and making mean the cause of the\ntrial, namely the murder of Clytemnestra, the\nmotive urged in defence, namely the murder of\nAgamemnon. But there is such lack of agreement\nover these two words, that some make the cause\nof the trial and the motive of the deed, while\nothers reverse the meanings. If we turn to Latin\nwriters we find that some have given these causes the\nnames of initinum, the beginning, and ratio, the reason,\nwhile others give the same name to both. Moreover\ncause seems to spring from cause, or as the Greeks say as will be seen from the following\nClytemnestra killed Agamemnon, because he had\nsacrificed their daughter and brought home a captive\nwoman as his paramour. The same authors think\nthat there may be several lines of defence to one\nquestion for instance Orestes may urge that he\nkilled his mother because driven to do so by oracles.\nBut the number of points for the decision of the judge\nwill be the same as the number of alleged motives for\nthe deed in this case it will be whether he ought to\nhave obeyed the oracles. But one alleged motive may\nalso in my opinion involve several questions and several\npoints for the decision of the judge, as for instance\nin the case when the husband caught his wife in\nadultery and slew her and later slew the adulterer,\nwho had escaped, in the market place. The motive is\nbut one But there arise\nas questions and points for decision by the judge, whether it was lawful to kill him at that time and at that\nplace. But just as, although there be several questions,\neach with its special basis, the basis of the case is but\none, namely that to which all else is referred, even so\nthe real point for the decision of the judge is, strictly\nspeaking, that on which judgment is given. As for\nthe the central argument, as I have mentioned\nit is called by some, or the foundation as it is called by\nothers, or as Cicero styles it the strongest argument of\nthe defender and the most relevant to the decision of the\njudge, some regard it as being the point after which\nall enquiry ceases, others as the main point for\nadjudication. The motive of the deed does not arise\nin all controversial cases. For how can there be a\nmotive for the deed, when the deed is denied But\nwhen the motive for the deed does come up for\ndiscussion, they deny that the point for the decision of\nthe judge rests on the same ground as the main question\nat issue, and this view is maintained by Cicero in his\nRhetorica and Partitiones. For when it has been\nasserted and denied that a deed was done, the question whether it was done is resolved by conjecture, and\nthe decision of the judge and the main question rest on\nthe same ground, since the first question and the\nfinal decision are concerned with the same point.\nBut when it is stated and denied that Orestes was\njustified in killing his mother, considerations of quality\nare introduced the question is whether he was justified in killing her, but this is not yet the point for the\ndecision of the judge. When, then, does it become so The\npoint for the decision of the judge is whether it was his\nduty to kill her. As regards the foundation, I will put it in the words of Cicero himself Others again use illustrations such as the following The\nquestion is whether everyone that spends his patrimony\nis to be prohibited, while the point for decision is\nwhether he who spent it in such a way is to be\nprohibited. Or again take the case of the soldier\nArruntius, who killed the tribune Lusius for assaulting\nhis honour. The question is whether he was justified\nin so doing, the line of defence, that the murdered man\nmade an assault upon his honour, the point for the\ndecision of the judge, whether it was right that a man\nshould be killed uncondemned or a tribune by a\nsoldier. Some even regard the basis of the question\nas being different from the basis of the decision.\nThe question as to whether Milo was justified in\nkilling Clodius, is one of quality. The point for the\ndecision of the judge, namely whether Clodius lay in\nwait for Milo, is a matter for conjecture. They also\nurge that a case is often diverted to the consideration\nof some matter irrelevant to the question, and that it is\non this matter that judgment is given. I strongly\ndisagree. Take the question whether all who have\nspent their patrimony are to be prohibited from\naddressing the people. This question must have its\npoint for decision, and therefore the question and the\npoint for decision are not different, but there are more than one question and more than one point for decision\nin the case. Again, in the case of Milo, is not the\nquestion of fact ultimately referred to the question of\nquality For if Clodius lay in wait for Milo, it follows\nthat he was justifiably killed. But when the case is\nshifted to some other point far removed from the\noriginal question, even in this case the question will\nbe found to reside in the point for decision. As regards these questions Cicero is slightly inconsistent with himself. For in the Rhetorica, as I\nhave already mentioned, he followed Hermagoras,\nwhile in the Topicai he holds that the or\ndisputed point is originated by the basis, and in\naddressing the lawyer Trebatius on this subject he\ncalls it the point at issue, and describes the elements\nin which it resides as central arguments or foundations\nof the defence which hold it together and the removal of\nwhich causes the whole defence to fall to the ground. But\nin the Partitiones Oratoriae he gives the name of\nfoundation to that which is advanced against the defence, on the ground that the central argument, as it\nlogically comes first, is put forward by the accuser,\nwhile the line of defence is put forward by the accused,\nand the point for the decision of the judge arises from\nthe question jointly raised by the central argument\nand the line of defence. The view therefore of those who make the basis,\nthe central argument, and the point for the decision of\nthe judge identical, is at once more concise and nearer\nto the truth. The central argument, they point out,\nis that the removal of which makes the whole case fall\nto the ground. In this central argument they seem to\nme to have included both the alleged causes, that Orestes killed his mother and that Clytemnestra\nkilled Agamemnon. the same authorities have likewise always held that the basis and the point for the\ndecision of the judge are in agreement; any other\nopinion would have been inconsistent with their\ngeneral views. But this affectation of subtlety in the invention of\ntechnical terms is mere laborious ostentation I have\nundertaken the task of discussing them solely that I\nmight not be regarded as having failed to make sufficient inquiry into the subject which I have chosen as\nmy theme. But it is quite unnecessary for an instructor proceeding on less technical lines to destroy\nthe coherence of his teaching by attention to such\nminute detail. Many however suffer from this drawback, more especially Hermagoras who, although he\nlabours these points with such anxious diligence, was\na man of penetrating intellect and in most respects\ndeserves our admiration, so that even where we must\nneeds blame him, we cannot withhold a certain meed\nof praise. But the shorter method, which for that\nvery reason is also by far the most lucid, will not\nfatigue the learner by leading him through a maze of\ndetail, nor destroy the coherence of his eloquence by\nbreaking it up into a number of minute departments.\nFor he who has a clear view of the main issue of a dispute, and divines the aims which his own side and his\nopponents intend to follow and the means they intend\nto employ and it is to the intentions of his own side\nthat he must pay special attention, will without a\ndoubt be in possession of a knowledge of all the points\nwhich I have discussed above. And there is hardly\nanyone, unless he be a born fool without the least\nacquaintance with the practice of speaking, who does not know what is the main issue of a dispute or as\nthey call it the cause or central argument and what is\nthe question between the parties and the point on which\nthe judge has to decide, these three being identical.\nFor the question is concerned with the matter in dispute and the decision of the judge is given on the\npoint involved in the question. Still we do not keep\nour attention rigidly fixed on such details, but the\ndesire to win praise by any available means and the\nsheer delight in speaking make us wander away from\nthe subject, since there is always richer material for\neloquence outside the strict theme of the case, inasmuch as the points of any given dispute are always\nfew, and there is all the world outside, and in the one\ncase we speak according to our instructions, in the\nother on the subjects of our own choice. We should\nteach not so much that it is our duty to discover the\nquestion, the central argument, and the point for the decision of the judge an easy task, as that we should\ncontinually keep our attention on our subject, or if\nwe digress, at least keep looking back to it, lest in\nour desire to win applause we should let our weapons\ndrop from our grasp. The school of Theodorus, as I\nhave said, groups everything under heads, by which\nthey mean several things. First they mean the main\nquestion, which is to be identified with the basis;\nsecondly they mean the other questions dependent\non the main question, thirdly the proposition and the\nstatement of the proofs. The word is used as we use it\nwhen we say or, as Menander says, But generally\nspeaking, anything which has to be proved will be a\nhead of varying degrees of importance. I have now set forth the principles laid down by\nthe writers of text-books, though I have done so\nat a greater length than was necessary. I have\nalso explained what are the various parts of forensic\ncauses. My next book therefore shall deal with\nthe exordium. I have now, my dear Marcellus Victorius, completed the third book of the work which I have\ndedicated to you, and have nearly finished a quarter\nof my task, and am confronted with a motive for\nrenewed diligence and increased anxiety as to the\njudgment it may be found to deserve. For up to\nthis point we were merely discussing rhetoric\nbetween ourselves and, in the event of our system\nbeing regarded as inadequate by the world at large,\nwere prepared to content ourselves with putting it\ninto practice at home and to confine ourselves to the\neducation of your son and mine. But now Domitianus Augustus has entrusted me with the education\nof his sister's grandsons, and I should be undeserving of the honour conferred upon me by such\ndivine appreciation, if I were not to regard this\ndistinction as the standard by which the greatness\nof my undertaking must be judged. For it is\nclearly my duty to spare no pains in moulding\nthe character of my august pupils, that they may\nearn the deserved approval of the most righteous\nof censors. The same applies to their intellectual training, for I would not be found to have disappointed the expectations of a prince pre-eminent\nin eloquence as in all other virtues. But no one\nis surprised at the frequency with which the\ngreatest poets invoke the Muses not merely at the\ncommencement of their works, but even further\non when they have reached some important passage\nand repeat their vows and utter fresh prayers for\nassistance. Assuredly therefore I may ask indulgence\nfor doing what I omitted to do when I first entered\non this task and calling to my aid all the gods and\nHimself before them all for his power is unsurpassed and there is no deity that looks with such\nfavour upon learning, beseeching him to inspire me\nwith genius in proportion to the hopes that he has\nraised in me, to lend me propitious and ready aid and\nmake me even such as he has believed me to be.\nAnd this, though the greatest, is not the only\nmotive for this act of religious devotion, but my work is\nof such a nature that, as it proceeds, I am confronted\nwith greater and more arduous obstacles than have\nyet faced me. For my next task is to explain the\norder to be followed in forensic causes, which\npresent the utmost complication and variety. I must\nset forth the function of the exordium, the method\nof the statement of facts, the cogency of proofs, whether\nwe are confirming our own assertions or refuting\nthose of our opponents, and the force of theperoration,\nwhether we have to refresh the memory of the\njudge by a brief recapitulation of the facts, or to do\nwhat is far more effective, stir his emotions. Some\nhave preferred to give each of these points separate\ntreatment, fearing that if they undertook them as\na whole the burden would be greater than they could bear, and consequently have published several\nbooks on each individual point. I have ventured\nto treat them altogether and foresee such infinite\nlabour that I feel weary at the very thought of the\ntask I have undertaken. But I have set my hand to\nthe plough and must not look back. My strength\nmay fail me, but my courage must not fail. 1. The commencement or exorditum as we call it in\nLatin is styled a proem by the Greeks. This seems\nto me a more appropriate name, because whereas we\nmerely indicate that we are beginning our task, they\nclearly show that this portion is designed as an introduction to the subject on which the orator has to\nspeak. It may be because means a tune, and\nplayers on the lyre have given the name of proem to\nthe prelude which they perform to win the favour of\nthe audience before entering upon the regular contest\nfor the prize, that orators before beginning to plead\nmake a few introductory remarks to win the indulgence of the judges. Or it may be because in Greek means a way, that the practice has arisen of\ncalling an introduction a proem. But in any case\nthere can be no doubt that by proem we mean the\nportion of a speech addressed to the judge before he\nhas begun to consider the actual case. And it is a\nmistaken practice which we adopt in the schools of\nalways assuming in our exordia that the judge is\nalready acquainted with the case. This form of\nlicence arises from the fact that a sketch of the case\nis always given before actual declamation. Such\nkinds of exordia may, however, be employed in the courts, when a case comes on for the second time, but\nnever or rarely on the first occasion, unless we are\nspeaking before a judge who has knowledge of\nthe case from some other source. The sole purpose of the exordium is to prepare our\naudience in such a way that they will be disposed to\nlend a ready ear to the rest of our speech. The\nmajority of authors agree that this is best effected in\nthree ways, by making the audience well-disposed,\nattentive and ready to receive instruction. I need\nhardly say that these aims have to be kept in\nview throughout the whole speech, but they are especially necessary at the commencement, when we\ngain admission to the mind of the judge in order\nto penetrate still further. As regards good-will, we secure that either from\npersons connected with the case or from the case\nitself. Most writers have divided these persons into\nthree classes, the plaintiff, the defendant and the\njudge. This classification is wrong, for the exordium\nmay sometimes derive its conciliatory force from the\nperson of the pleader. For although he may be\nmodest and say little about himself, yet if he is\nbelieved to be a good man, this consideration will\nexercise the strongest influence at every point of\nthe case. For thus he will have the good fortune to\ngive the impression not so much that he is a\nzealous advocate as that he is an absolutely reliable\nwitness. It is therefore pre-eminently desirable\nthat he should be believed to have undertaken\nthe case out of a sense of duty to a friend or\nrelative, or even better, if the point can be made,\nby a sense of patriotism or at any rate some serious\nmoral consideration. No doubt it is even more necessary for the parties themselves to create the\nimpression that they have been forced to take legal\naction by some weighty and honourable reason or even\nby necessity. But just as the authority of the speaker\ncarries greatest weight, if his undertaking of the case\nis free from all suspicion of meanness, personal spite\nor ambition, so also we shall derive some silent support\nfrom representing that we are weak, unprepared, and\nno match for the powerful talents arrayed against us,\na frequent trick in the exordia of Messala. For\nmen have a natural prejudice in favour of those\nwho are struggling against difficulties, and a scrupulous judge is always specially ready to listen to an\nadvocate whom he does not suspect to have designs\non his integrity. Hence arose the tendency of\nancient orators to pretend to conceal their eloquence,\na practice exceedingly unlike the ostentation of our\nown times. It is also important to avoid giving the\nimpression that we are abusive, malignant, proud\nor slanderous toward any individual or body of\nmen, especially such as cannot be hurt without\nexciting the disapproval of the judges. As to the\njudge, it would be folly for me to warn speakers\nnot to say or even hint anything against him, but\nfor the fact that such things do occur. Our opponent's advocate will sometimes provide us with\nmaterial for our exordium we may speak of him\nin honorific terms, pretending to fear his eloquence\nand influence with a view to rendering them suspect\nto the judge, or occasionally, though very seldom, we\nmay abuse him, as Asinius did in his speech on behalf\nof the heirs of Urbinia, where he includes among the\nproofs of the weakness of the plaintiff's case the fact\nthat he has secured Labienus as his advocate. Cornelius Celsus denies that such remarks can be\nconsidered as belonging to the exordium on the\nground that they are irrelevant to the actual case.\nPersonally I prefer to follow the authority of the\ngreatest orators, and hold that whatever concerns the\npleader is relevant to the case, since it is natural that\nthe judges should give readier credence to those to\nwhom they find it a pleasure to listen. The character\nof our client himself may, too, be treated in various\nways we may emphasise his worth or we may\ncommend his weakness to the protection of the\ncourt. Sometimes it is desirable to set forth his\nmerits, when the speaker will be less hampered by\nmodesty than if he were praising his own. Sex, age\nand situation are also important considerations, as for\ninstance when women, old men or wards are pleading\nin the character of wives, parents or children.\nFor pity alone may move even a strict judge.\nThese points, however, should only be lightly touched\nupon in the exordium, not run to death. As regards\nour opponent he is generally attacked on similar\nlines, but with the method reversed. For power is\ngenerally attended by envy, abject meanness by\ncontempt, guilt and baseness by hatred, three\nemotions which are powerful factors to alienate the\ngood-will of the judges. But a simple statement will\nnot suffice, for even the uneducated are capable of\nthat most of the points will require exaggeration\nor extenuation as expediency may demand the\nmethod of treatment belongs to the orator, the\npoints themselves belong to the case. We shall win the good-will of the judge not\nmerely by praising him, which must be done with\ntact and is an artifice common to both parties, but by linking his praise to the furtherance of our own\ncase. For instance, in pleading for a man of good\nbirth we shall appeal to his own high rank, in speaking\nfor the lowly we shall lay stress on his sense of justice, on his pity in pleading the cause of misfortune,\nand on his severity when we champion the victims\nof wrong, and so on. I should also wish, if possible,\nto be acquainted with the character of the judge.\nFor it will be desirable to enlist their temperaments\nin the service of our cause, where they are such as\nare like to be useful, or to mollify them, if they are\nlike to prove adverse, just according as they are\nharsh, gentle, cheerful, grave, stern, or easy-going.\nIt will, however, sometimes happen that the judge\nis hostile to us and friendly to our adversaries. Such\ncases demand the attention of both parties and I am\nnot sure that the party favoured by the judge does\nnot require to handle the situation with even more\ncare than his opponent. For perverse judges have\nsometimes a preposterous tendency to give judgment against their friends or in favour of those with\nwhom they have a quarrel, and of committing injustice merely to avoid the appearance of partiality.\nAgain some have been judges in cases where their\nown interests were involved. I note, for instance,\nin the books of observations published by Septimius\nthat Cicero appeared in such a case, while I myself,\nwhen I appeared on behalf of Queen Berenice,\nactually pleaded before her. In such cases we must\nbe guided by the same principles that I have laid\ndown above. The opponent of the judge will\nemphasise his confidence in the justice of his client's\ncause, while the advocate of his interests will\nexpress the fear that the judge may be influenced by a quixotic delicacy. Further, if the judge is\nthought to have come into court with a prejudice\nin favour of one side, we must try to remove or\nstrengthen that prejudice as circumstances may\ndemand. Again occasionally we shall have to calm\nthe judges' fears, as Cicero does in the pro Milone,\nwhere he strives to persuade them not to think that\nPompey's soldiers have been stationed in the court\nas a threat to themselves. Or it may be necessary\nto frighten them, as Cicero does in the Verrines.\nThere are two ways of bringing fear to bear upon\nthe judges. The commonest and most popular is to\nthreaten them with the displeasure of the Roman\npeople or the transference of the juries to another\nclass; the second is somewhat brutal and is rarely\nemployed, and consists in threatening them with a\nprosecution for bribery this is a method which is\nfairly safe with a large body of judges, since it\nchecks the bad and pleases the good members of\nthe jury, but I should never recommend its employment with a single judge except in the very last\nresort. But if necessity should drive us to such a\ncourse, we must remember that such threats do not\ncome under the art of oratory, any more than appeals\nfrom the judgment of the court though that is often\nuseful, or the indictment of the judge before he\ngives his decision. For even one who is no orator\ncan threaten or lay an information. If the case affords us the means of winning the\nfavour of the judge, it is important that the points\nwhich seem most likely to serve to our purpose\nshould be selected for introduction into the exordium. On this subject Verginius falls into error, for he\nasserts that Theodorus lays down that some one\nreflexion on each individual question that is involved\nby the case should be introduced into the exordium.\nAs a matter of fact Theodorus does not say this,\nbut merely that the judge should be prepared for\nthe most important of the questions that are to be\nraised. There is nothing to object to in this rule,\nsave that he would make it of universal application,\nwhereas it is not possible with every question nor\ndesirable in every case. For instance, seeing that\nthe plaintiff's advocate speaks first, and that\ntill he has spoken the judge is ignorant of the\nnature of the dispute, how is it possible for us to\nintroduce reflexions relating to all the questions\ninvolved The facts of the case must be stated\nbefore that can be done. We may grant that some\nquestions may be mentioned, for that will sometimes\nbe absolutely necessary; but can we introduce all\nthe most important questions, or in other words the\nwhole case If we do we shall have completed our\nstatement of facts within the limits of the exordium.\nAgain if, as often happens, the case is somewhat\ndifficult, surely we should seek to win the good-will\nof the judge by other portions of our speech sooner\nthan thrust the main questions upon him in all their\nnaked harshness before we have done anything to\nsecure his favour. If the main questions ought\nalways to be treated at the beginning of a speech,\nwe might dispense with the exordium. We shall\nthen occasionally introduce certain points from the\nmain questions into the exordium, which will exercise\na valuable influence in winning the judge to regard\nus with favour. It is not necessary to enumerate the points which are likely to gain us such favour,\nbecause they will be obvious as soon as we have\nacquainted ourselves with the circumstances of each\ndispute, while in view of the infinite variety presented by cases it is out of the question to specify\nthem here. Just, however, as it is in the interest\nof our case to note and amplify these points, so it is\nalso to rebut or at any rate lessen the force of\nanything that is damaging to our case. Again\nour case may justify an appeal to compassion with\nregard to what we have suffered in the past or are\nlikely to suffer. For I do not share the opinion\nheld by some, that the exordium and the peroration\nare to be distinguished by the fact that the latter\ndeals with the past, the former with the future.\nRather I hold that the difference between them is\nthis in our opening any preliminary appeal to the\ncompassion of the judge must be made sparingly\nand with restraint, while in the peroration we may\ngive full rein to our emotions, place fictitious\nspeeches in the mouths of our characters, call the\ndead to life, and produce the wife or children of the\naccused in court, practices which are less usual in\nexordia. But it is the function of the exordium not\nmerely to excite the feelings to which I have alluded,\nbut to do all that is possible to show that our\nopponent's case is not deserving of them. It is\nadvantageous to create the impression not merely\nthat our fate will be deserving of pity, if we lose, but\nthat our adversary will be swollen with outrageous\ninsolence if he prove successful. But exordia are often drawn from matters which\ndo not, strictly speaking, concern either cases or the\npersons involved, though not unrelated to either. In such relation to persons stand not only wives\nand children of whom I have just spoken, but also\nrelations, friends, and at times districts and states\ntogether with anything else that is like to suffer\ninjury from the fall of the client whom we defend.\nAs regards external circumstances which have a\nbearing on the case, I may mention time, which\nis introduced in the exordium of the pro Caelio,\nplace in the pro Deiotaro,the appearance of the\ncourt in the pro Milone,public opinion in the\nVerrines,and finally, as I cannot mention all,\nthe ill-repute of the law courts and the popular\nexpectation excited by the case. None of these\nactually belong to the case, but all have some\nbearing on it. Theophrastus adds that the exordium\nmay be drawn from the speech of one's opponent,\nas that of the pro Ctesiphonte of Demosthenes appears\nto be, where he asks that he may be allowed to\nspeak as he pleases and not to be restricted to the\nform laid down by the accuser in his speech. Confidence often labours under the disadvantage\nof being regarded as arrogance. But there are\ncertain tricks for acquiring good-will, which though\nalmost universal, are by no means to be neglected, if\nonly to prevent their being first employed against\nourselves. I refer to rhetorical expressions of wishing, detestation, entreaty, or anxiety. For it keeps\nthe judge's attention on the alert, if he is led to\nthink the case novel, important, scandalous, or\nlikely to set a precedent, still more if he is excited\nby concern for himself or the common weal, when his mind must be stirred by hope, fear, admonition,\nentreaty and even by falsehood, if it seems to us\nthat it is likely to advance our case. We shall also\nfind it a useful device for wakening the attention of\nour audience to create the impression that we shall\nnot keep them long and intend to stick closely to\nthe point. The mere fact of such attention undoubtedly makes the judge ready to receive instruction from us, but we shall contribute still more to\nthis effect if we give a brief and lucid summary of\nthe case which he has to try; in so doing we shall\nbe following the method adopted by Homer and\nVirgil at the beginning of their poems. For as regards\nthe length of the exordium, it should propound rather\nthan expound, and should not describe how each\nthing occurred, but simply indicate the points on\nwhich the orator proposes to speak. I do not think\na better example of this can be found than the\nexordium to the pro Cluentio of Cicero. All this, however, is easier for the defender\nthan the prosecutor, since the latter has merely to remind the judge, while the former has to instruct him.\nNor shall any authority, however great, induce me\nto abandon my opinion that it is always desirable to\nrender the judge attentive and ready to receive instruction. I am well aware that those who disagree with me urge that it is to the advantage of a\nbad case that its nature should not be understood;\nbut such lack of understanding arises not from\ninattention on the part of the judge, but from his\nbeing deceived. Our opponent has spoken and\nperhaps convinced him; we must alter his opinion,\nand this we cannot do unless we render him attentive\nto what we have to say and ready to be instructed.\nWhat are we to do then I agree to the view that\nwe should cut down, depreciate and deride some of\nour opponent's arguments with a view to lessening\nthe attention shown him by the judge, as Cicero did\nin the pro Ligario. For what was the purpose of\nCicero's irony save that Caesar should be induced to\nregard the case as presenting only old familiar\nfeatures and consequently to give it less attention\nWhat was his purpose in the pro Caelio save to\nmake the case seem far more trivial than had been\nanticipated It is, however, obvious that of the rules which I\nhave laid down, some will be applicable to one case\nand some to another. The majority of writers\nconsider that there are five kinds of causes, the\nhonourable, the mean, the doubtful or ambiguous, the\nextraordinary and the obscure, or as they are called in\nGreek, and To these some would add a sixth,\nthe scandalous, which some again include under the\nheading of the mean, others under the extraordinary.\nThe latter name is given to cases which are contrary\nto ordinary expectation. In ambiguous cases it is\nspecially important to secure the good-will of the\njudge, in the obscure to render him ready to receive instruction, in the mean to excite his attention. As\nregards the honourable the very nature of the case is\nsufficient to win the approval of the judge; in the\nscandalous and extraordinary some kind of palliation\nis required. Some therefore divide the exordium into two parts,\nthe introduction and the insinuation, making the former\ncontain a direct appeal to the good-will and attention\nof the judge. But as this is impossible in scandalous\ncases, they would have the orator on such occasions insinuate himself little by little into the minds of his\njudges, especially when the features of the case which\nmeet the eye are discreditable, or because the subject\nis disgraceful or such as to meet with popular disapproval, or again if the outward circumstances of the\ncase are such as to handicap it or excite odium as for\ninstance when a patron appears against a client or a\nfather against a son, or pity as when our opponent\nis an old or blind man or a child. To save the situation the rhetoricians lay down a number of rules at\nquite inordinate length they invent fictitious cases\nand treat them realistically on the lines which would\nbe followed in actual pleading. But these peculiar\ncircumstances arise from such a variety of causes as\nto render classification by species impossible, and\ntheir enumeration save under the most general heads\nwould be interminable. The line to be adopted will\ntherefore depend on the individual nature of each\ncase. As a general principle, however, I should\nadvise the avoidance of points which tell against us\nand concentrate on those which are likely to be of\nservice. If the case itself is weak, we may derive\nhelp from the character of our client; if his character\nis doubtful, we may find salvation in the nature of the case. If both are hopeless, we must look out for\nsomething that will damage our opponent. For\nthough it is desirable to secure as much positive\ngood-will as possible, the next best thing is to incur\nthe minimum of actual dislike. Where we cannot\ndeny the truth of facts that are urged against us, we\nmust try to show that their significance has been\nexaggerated or that the purpose of the act was not\nwhat is alleged or that the facts are irrelevant or\nthat what was done may be atoned for by penitence\nor has already been sufficiently punished. It is\nconsequently easier for an advocate to put forward\nsuch pleas than for his client, since the former can\npraise without laying himself open to the charge of\narrogance and may sometimes even reprove him with\nadvantage to the case. At times, like Cicero in his\ndefence of Rabirius Postumus, he will pretend that\nhe himself is strongly moved, in order to win the\near of the judge and to give the impression of\none who is absolutely convinced of the truth of his\ncause, that so his statements may find all the readier\ncredence whether he defends or denies the actions\nattributed to his client. Consequently it is of the first\nimportance, wherever the alternative is open to us,\nto consider whether we are to adopt the character of\na party to the suit or of an advocate. In the schools,\nof course, we have a free choice in the matter, but it\nis only on rare occasions that a man is capable of\npleading his own case in the actual courts. When\nwe are going to deliver a declamation on a theme\nthat turns largely on its emotional features, we\nmust give it a dramatic character suited to the\npersons concerned. For emotions are not transferable at will, nor can we give the same forcible expression to another man's emotions that we should\ngive to our own. The circumstances which call for\ninsinuation arise also in cases where the pleading of\nour opponent has made a powerful impression on the\nminds of the judges, or where the audience whom\nwe have to address are tired. The first difficulty we\nshall evade by promising to produce our own proofs\nand by eluding the arguments of our opponents, the\nsecond by holding out hopes that we shall be brief\nand by the methods already mentioned for capturing\nthe attention of the judges. Again an opportune\ndisplay of wit will often restore their flagging spirits\nand we may alleviate their boredom by the introduction of entertaining matter derived from any source\nthat may be available. It will also be found advantageous to anticipate the objections that may be\nraised by our opponent, as Cicero does when he\nsays he then goes on to show\nthat the accusation which he has undertaken is\nreally a defence of the allies, an artifice known as or anticipation. Although this is at times\na useful device, some of our declaimers employ it\non practically every occasion, on the assumption\nthat one should always start with the order thus\nreversed. The adherents of Apollodorus reject the view\nstated above to the effect that there are only three\nrespects in which the mind of the judge requires to\nbe prepared, and enumerate many others, relating to\nthe character of the judge, to opinions regarding\nmatters which though outside the case have still some bearing on it, to the opinion current as to the\ncase itself, and so on ad infinitum to these they add\nothers relating to the elements of which every\ndispute is composed, such as persons, deeds, words,\nmotives, time and place, occasions and the like.\nSuch views are, I admit, perfectly correct, but are\ncovered by one or other of the three classes which I\nhave mentioned. For if I can secure good-will,\nattention and readiness to learn on the part of my\njudge, I cannot see what else I ought to require;\neven fear, which perhaps may be thought more than\nanything else to lie outside the considerations I have\nmentioned, secures the attention of the judge and\ndeters him from favouring our opponent. It is not, however, sufficient to explain the nature\nof the exordium to our pupils. We must also indicate\nthe easiest method of composing an exordium. I\nwould therefore add that he who has a speech to\nmake should consider what he has to say; before\nwhom, in whose defence, against whom, at what\ntime and place, under what circumstances he has to\nspeak; what is the popular opinion on the subject,\nand what the prepossessions of the judge are likely\nto be; and finally of what we should express our\ndeprecation or desire. Nature herself will give him\nthe knowledge of what he ought to say first. Nowadays, however, speakers think that anything with\nwhich they choose to start is a proem and that\nwhatever occurs to them, especially if it be a reflexion\nthat catches their fancy, is an exordium. There are,\nno doubt, many points that can be introduced into an\nexordium which are common to other parts of a speech,\nbut the best test of the appropriateness of a point to\nany part of a speech is to consider whether it would lose effect by being placed elsewhere. A most attractive form of exordium is that which draws its material\nfrom the speech of our opponent, if only for the\nreason that the fact of its not having been composed\nat home, but having been improvised on the spot to\nmeet the needs of the case increases the orator's\nreputation for natural talent by the readiness with\nwhich it is produced and carries conviction owing to\nthe simple and ordinary language in which it is\nclothed. As a result, even although the rest of the\nspeech has been committed to writing and carefully\nelaborated, the whole of the speech will often be\nregarded as extempore, simply because its commencement is clearly not the result of previous\nstudy. Indeed a certain simplicity in the thoughts,\nstyle, voice and look of the speaker will often\nproduce so pleasing an effect in the exordium that\neven in a case where there is no room for doubt the\nconfidence of the speaker should not reveal itself too\nopenly. For as a rule the judge dislikes self-confidence in a pleader, and conscious of his rights\ntacitly demands the respectful deference of the\norator. No less care must be taken to avoid exciting\nany suspicion in this portion of our speech, and we\nshould therefore give no hint of elaboration in the\nexordium, since any art that the orator may employ\nat this point seems to be directed solely at the\njudge. But to avoid all display of art in itself\nrequires consummate art this admirable canon has\nbeen insisted on by all writers, though its force has\nbeen somewhat impaired by present conditions, since\nin certain trials, more especially those brought on\ncapital charges or in the centumviral court, the\njudges themselves demand the most finished and elaborate speeches, think themselves insulted, unless\nthe orator shows signs of having exercised the\nutmost diligence in the preparation of his speech,\nand desire not merely to be instructed, but to be\ncharmed. It is difficult to preserve the happy mean\nin carrying this precept into effect but by a skilful\ncompromise it will be possible to give the impression\nof speaking with care but without elaborate design.\nThe old rule still holds good that no unusual word,\nno overbold metaphor, no phrase derived from the\nlumber-rooms of antiquity or from poetic licence\nshould be detected in the exordium. For our position\nis not yet established, the attention of the audience\nis still fresh and imposes restraint upon us as soon\nas we have won their good-will and kindled their\ninterest, they will tolerate such freedom, more\nespecially when we have reached topics whose\nnatural richness prevents any licence of expression\nbeing noticed in the midst of the prevailing\nsplendour of the passage. The style of the exrordiumn\nshould not resemble that of our purple patches nor\nthat of the argumentative and narrative portions of\nthe speech, nor yet should it be prolix or continuously ornate it should rather seem simple and\nunpremeditated, while neither our words nor our\nlooks should promise too much. For a method of\npleading which conceals its art and makes no vain\ndisplay, being as the Greeks say will\noften be best adapted to insinuate its way into the\nminds of our hearers. But in all this we must be\nguided by the extent to which it is expedient to\nimpress the minds of the judges. There is no point in the whole speech where confusion of memory or loss of fluency has a worse effect, for a faulty exordium is like a face seamed with scars;\nand he who runs his ship ashore while leaving port\nis certainly the least efficient of pilots. The length\nof the exordium will be determined by the case;\nsimple cases require a short introduction only,\nlonger exordia being best suited to cases which are\ncomplicated, suspect or unpopular. As for those\nwho have laid it down as a law applying to all\nexordia that they should not be more than four\nsentences long, they are merely absurd. On the\nother hand undue length is equally to be avoided,\nlest the head should seem to have grown out of all\nproportion to the body and the judge should be\nwearied by that which ought to prepare him for\nwhat is to follow. The figure which the Greeks\ncall apostrophe, by which is meant the diversion of\nour words to address some person other than the\njudge, is entirely banned by some rhetoricians as\nfar as the exordium is concerned, and for this they\nhave some reason, since it would certainly seem to\nbe more natural that we should specially address\nourselves to those whose favour we desire to win.\nOccasionally however some striking expression of\nthought is necessary in the exordium which can be\ngiven greater point and vehemence if addressed to\nsome person other than the judge. In such a case\nwhat law or what preposterous superstition is to\nprevent us from adding force to such expression\nof our thought by the use of this figure For the\nwriters of text-books do not forbid it because they\nregard it as illicit, but because they think it useless.\nConsequently if its utility be proved, we shall have\nto employ it for the very reason for which we are\nnow forbidden to do so. Moreover Demosthenes turns to address Aeschines in his exordium, while\nCicero adopts the same device in several of his\nspeeches, but more especially in the pro Ligario,\nwhere he turns to address Tubero. His speech\nwould have been much less effective, if any other\nfigure had been used, as will be all the more clearly\nrealised, if the whole of that most vigorous passage be altered so as to be addressed to the judge. For\nit is a real and most unnatural diversion of the\npassage, which destroys its whole force, if we say In the\noriginal form Cicero attacks his opponent and\npresses him hard, in the passage as altered he\nwould merely have pointed out a fact. The same\nthing results if you alter the turn of the passage in\nDemosthenes. Again did not Sallust when\nspeaking against Cicero himself address his exordium\nto him and not to the judge In fact he actually\nopens with the words wherein he followed the precedent set by Cicero\nin his speech against Catiline where he opens with\nthe words Finally to remove all reason for\nfeeling surprise at the employment of apostrophe,\nCicero in his defence of Scaurus, on a charge of\nbribery the speech is to be found in his Notebooks;\nfor he defended him twice actually introduces an\nimaginary person speaking on behalf of the accused,\nwhile in his pro Rahirio and his speech in defence\nof this same Scaurus on a charge of extortion he employs illustrations, and in the pro Cluentio, as I\nhave already pointed out, introduces division into\nheads. Still such artifices, although they may be\nemployed at times to good effect, are not to be\nindulged in indiscriminately, but only when there is\nstrong reason for breaking the rule. The same remark\napplies to simile which must however be brief,\nmetaphor and other tropes, all of which are forbidden\nby our cautious and pedantic teachers of rhetoric, but\nwhich we shall none the less occasionally employ,\nunless indeed we are to disapprove of the magnificent\nexample of irony in the pro Ligario to which I have\nalready referred a few pages back. The rhetoricians\nhave however been nearer the truth in their censure\nof certain other faults that may occur in the exordium.\nThe stock exordium which can be suited to a number\nof different cases they style vulgar; it is an unpopular\nform but can sometimes be effectively employed and\nhas often been adopted by some of the greatest orators.\nThe exordium which might equally well be used by\nour opponent, they style common. That which our\nopponent can turn to his own advantage, they call\ninterchangeable, that which is irrelevant to the case,\ndetached, and that which is drawn from some other\nspeech, transferred. In addition to these they\ncensure others as long and others as contrary to rule.\nMost of these faults are however not peculiar to the\nexordinum, but may be found in any or every portion\nof a speech. Such are the rules for the exordium, wherever it\nis employed. It may however sometimes be dispensed with. For occasionally it is superfluous, if\nthe judge has been sufficiently prepared for our\nspeech without it or if the case is such as to render such preparation unnecessary. Aristotle indeed\nsays that with good judges the exordium is entirely\nunnecessary. Sometimes however it is impossible\nto employ it, even if we desire to do so, when,\nfor instance, the judge is much occupied, when time\nis short or superior authority forces us to embark\nupon the subject right away. On the other hand\nit is at times possible to give the force of an exordium\nto other portions of the speech. For instance we\nmay ask the judges in the course of our statement of\nthe facts or of our arguments to give us their best\nattention and good-will, a proceeding which Prodicus\nrecommended as a means of wakening them when\nthey begin to nod. A good example is the\nfollowing Further if the case involves a number of different\nmatters, each section must be prefaced with a short\nintroduction, such as or Even in the\nproof there are many passages which perform the\nsame function as an exordium, such as the passage in\nthe pro Cluentio where Cicero introduces an attack\non the censors and in the pro Murena when he\napologises to Servius. But the practice is too\ncommon to need illustration. However on all occasions when we have employed\nthe exordium, whether we intend to pass to the statement\nof facts or direct to the proof, our intention should\nbe mentioned at the conclusion of the introduction,\nwith the result that the transition to what follows\nwill be smooth and easy. There is indeed a pedantic\nand childish affectation in vogue in the schools of marking the transition by some epigram and seeking\nto win applause by this feat of legerdemain. Ovid\nis given to this form of affectation in his Metamorphoses, but there is some excuse for him owing to the\nfact that he is compelled to weld together subjects\nof the most diverse nature so as to form a continuous\nwhole. But what necessity is there for an orator to\ngloss over his transitions or to attempt to deceive the\njudge, who requires on the contrary to be warned to\ngive his attention to the sequence of the various\nportions of the speech For instance the first part\nof our statement of the facts will be wasted, if the\njudge does not realise that we have reached that\nstage. Therefore, although we should not be too\nabrupt in passing to our statement of facts, it is best\nto do nothing to conceal our transition. Indeed, if\nthe statement of fact on which we are about to embark\nis somewhat long and complicated, we shall do well\nto prepare the judge for it, as Cicero often does,\nmost notably in the following passage This is practically all that I can find\nto say on the subject of the exordium. II. It is a most natural and frequently necessary\nproceeding, that after preparing the mind of the\njudge in the manner described above we should indicate the nature of the subject on which he will have\nto give judgment that is the statement of facts. In\ndealing with this question I shall deliberately pass\nover the divisions made by certain writers, who make\ntoo many classes and err on the side of subtlety. For they demand an explanation dealing not only with the\nfacts of the case which is before the court, but with the\nperson involved as in the sentence,  or of the\nplace where an incident occurred as in the sentence , or of the time at which something occurred as in the verse or of the causes of an occurrence, such as the\nhistorians are so fond of setting forth, when they\nexplain the origin of a war, a rebellion or a pestilence.\nFurther they style some statements of fact \nand others a distinction which is self-evident. To this they add that our explanation may\nrefer to the past which is of course the commonest\nform, the present for which compare Cicero's\nremarks about the excitement caused among the\nfriends of Chrysogonus when his name was mentioned, or of the future a form permissible only to\nprophets for hypotyposis or picturesque description\ncannot be regarded as a statement of facts. However\nlet us pass to matters of more importance. The majority regard the statement of facts as being\nindispensable but there are many considerations\nwhich show that this view is erroneous. In the first\nplace there are some cases which are so brief, that\nthey require only a brief summary rather than a full\nstatement of the facts. This may apply to both\nparties to a suit, as for instance in cases where there\nis no necessity for explanation or where the facts are admitted and the whole question turns on a point of\nlaw, as it so often does in the centumviral court, as\nfor example when we discuss, whether the heir of a\nwoman who has died intestate should be her son or\nbrother, or whether puberty is to be reckoned by age\nor by physical development. The same situation\narises also in cases where the facts admit of full\nstatement, but are well known to the judge or have\nbeen correctly set forth by a previous speaker.\nSometimes again the statement of facts can be\ndispensed with only by one party, who is generally\nthe plaintiff, either because it is sufficient for him to\nmake a simple summary of his case or because it is\nmore expedient for him to do so. It may, for instance, suffice to say, or It is for the other party to\nexplain why these sums are not due to the plaintiff.\nAgain it is sometimes sufficient and expedient to\nsummarise a case in one sentence such as For the judge will\nunderstand the whole charge from this simple\naffirmation the sequence of events and the motive\nfor the deed will be matters for the defence to expound. On the other hand in some cases the\naccused may dispense with the statement of facts,\nwhen for instance the charge can neither be denied\nnor palliated, but turns solely on some point of law\nthe following case will illustrate my meaning. A\nman who has stolen from a temple money belonging\nto a private individual is accused of sacrilege in\nsuch a case a confession will be more seemly than\na full statement of facts While however I think that there are occasional\ncases where the statement of facts may be dispensed\nwith, I disagree with those who say that there is no\nstatement of facts when the accused simply denies the\ncharge. This opinion is shared by Cornelius Celsus\nwho holds that most cases of murder and all of\nbribery and extortion fall into this class. For he\nthinks that the only statement of facts is that which\ngives a general account of the charge before the\ncourt. Yet he himself acknowledges that Cicero\nemployed the statement of facts in his defence of\nRabirius Postumus, in spite of the fact that Cicero\ndenies that any money came into the hands of\nRabirius and this was the question at issue and\ngives no explanations relating to the actual charge in\nhis statement of facts. For my part I follow the very\nhighest authorities in holding that there are two\nforms of statement of facts in forensic speeches, the\none expounding the facts of the case itself, the other\nsetting forth facts which have a bearing on the case.\nI agree that a sentence such as does not amount to a statement of facts\nbut there will be a statement of facts, occasionally, too,\na long one, in answer to the arguments put forward\nby the accuser it will deal with the past life of the\naccused, with the causes which have brought an\ninnocent man into peril, and other circumstances\nsuch as show the charge to be incredible. For the accuser does not merely say but\nsets forth the facts proving his assertion tragedy will\nprovide an example, where Teucer accuses Ulysses\nof murdering Ajax, and states that he was found in a\nlonely place near the lifeless body of his enemy with\na blood-stained sword in his hands. To this Ulysses\ndoes not merely reply that he did not do the deed,\nbut adds that he had no quarrel with Ajax, the\ncontest between them having been concerned solely\nwith the winning of renown he then goes on to\nsay how he came to be in the lonely place, how he\nfound Ajax lying lifeless and drew the sword from\nthe wound. Then follow arguments based on these\nfacts. But even when the accuser says and the accused says a statement of facts\nis involved; for he must say where he was. Consequently cases of bribery and extortion will require\nas many statements of this kind as there are\ncharges the charges themselves will be denied, but\nit will be necessary to counter the arguments of the\naccuser either singly or all together by setting forth\nthe facts in quite a different light. Is it, I ask you,\nirrelevant for one accused of bribery to set forth\nhis parentage, his past life and the services on which\nhe relied for success in his candidature And if a\nman is indicted for extortion, will it not be to his\nadvantage to set forth not merely his past record,\nbut also the reasons which have made the whole\nprovince or the accuser or a witness hostile to\nhimself If these are not statements of facts, neither\nis the first portion of Cicero's defence of Cluentius,\nbeginning with the words For there he says nothing about the charge of poisoning, but confines himself entirely to setting\nforth the reasons for the hostility of Cluentius'\nmother to her son. There are also statements\nwhich do not set forth the facts of the case itself,\nbut facts which are none the less relevant to the\ncase the speaker's purpose may be to illustrate the\ncase by some parallel, as in the passage in the\nVerrines about Lucius Domitius who crucified a\nshepherd because he admitted that he had used a\nhunting spear to kill the boar which he had brought\nhim as a present; or he may desire to dispel some\ncharge that is irrelevant to the case as in the passage\nof the speech for Rabirius Postumus, which runs as\nfollows Or the orator may desire to heighten\nthe effect of his charges, as Cicero does in his\ndescription of the journey of Verres. Sometimes a fictitious statement is employed\neither to stir the emotions of the judges, as in that\npassage of the proo Roscio Amerino dealing with\nChrysogonus to which I referred just recently, or to\nentertain them with a show of wit, as in the\npassage of the pro Cluentio describing the brothers\nCaepasius sometimes again a digression may be\nintroduced to add beauty to the speech, as in the\npassage about Proserpine in the Verrines, beginning All these examples serve to\nshow that he who denies a charge may not necessarily\nrefrain from stating, but may actually state that very\nfact which he denies. Even the assertion which I made above to the\neffect that a statement of facts familiar to the judge\nis superfluous, is not to be taken too literally. My\nmeaning is that it may be dispensed with, if the\njudge knows not merely what has been done, but\ntakes a view of the facts which is favourable to our\ncase. For the purpose of the statement of facts is\nnot merely to instruct, but rather to persuade the\njudge. Therefore, when we desire to influence him\nin some way or other, although he may require no\ninstruction, we shall preface our statement with\nsome such remarks as these At times again we may pretend\nthat we are repeating the facts for the benefit of\nsome new member of the jury, at times that we do\nso with a view to letting every bystander as well realise\nthe gross unfairness of our opponents' assertions.\nUnder these circumstances our statement must be\ndiversified by a free use of figures to avoid wearying\nthose to whom the facts are familiar we shall for\ninstance use phrases such as , and so on. Besides, if we are always to\nregard as superfluous a statement of facts made before\na judge who is familiar with the case, we may even\ngo so far as to regard it as superfluous at times to\nplead the case at all. There is a further question which is still more\nfrequently raised, as to whether the statement of\nfacts should always follow immediately on the exordium. Those who hold that it should always do so\nmust be admitted to have some reason on their side.\nFor since the purpose of the exordium is to make\nthe judge more favourably disposed and more\nattentive to our case and more amenable to\ninstruction, and since the proof cannot be brought\nforward until the facts of the case are known, it\nseems right that the judge should be instructed in\nthe facts without delay. But the practice may be\naltered by circumstances, unless it is contended that\nCicero in his magnificent published defence of Milo\ndelayed his statement too long by placing three\nquestions before it; or unless it is argued that, if it\nbad been held to be impermissible to defend a man\nat all who acknowledged that he had killed another,\nor if Milo's case had already been prejudged and\ncondemnation passed by the senate, or if Gnaeus\nPompeius, who in addition to exerting his influence\nin other ways had surrounded the court with an\narmed guard, had been regarded with apprehension\nas hostile to the accused, it would have served his\ncase to set forth how Clodius had set an ambush for\nMilo. These three questions, then, served the\npurpose of an exordium, since they all of them were\ndesigned to prepare the minds of the judges.\nAgain in the pro Vareno Cicero delayed his\nstatement of facts until he had first rebutted\ncertain allegations put forward by the prosecution.\nThis may be done with advantage whenever we\nhave not merely to rebut the charge, but to turn\nthe tables on our opponents thus after first\nrebutting the charge, we make our statement of\nfacts the opening of an incrimination of the other\nparty just as in actual fighting we are most concerned to parry our adversary's blows before\nwe strike him ourselves. There will also not\ninfrequently be certain cases, in which it is easy to\nrebut the charge that is under trial, but the conduct\nof which is hampered by the past life of our client\nand the many and serious crimes which he has\ncommitted. We must dispose of these first, in order\nthat the judge may give a favourable hearing to our\ndefence of the actual facts which form the question\nat issue. For example, if we have to defend\nMarcus Caelius, the best course for his advocate to\nadopt will be to meet the imputations of luxury,\nwantonness and immorality which are made against\nhim before we proceed to the actual charge of poisoning. It is with these points that the speech of Cicero\nin his defence is entirely concerned. Is he then to\ngo on to make a statement about the property of\nPalla and explain the whole question of rioting, a\ncharge against which Caelius has already defended\nhimself in the speech which he delivered on his own\nbehalf We however are the victims of the practice\nof the schools in accordance with which certain points\nor themes as we call them are put forward for discussion, outside which our refutation must not go,\nand consequently a statement of facts always follows\nthe exordium. It is this too that leads declaimers to\ntake the liberty of inserting a statement of facts even\nwhen they speak second for their side. For when\nthey speak for the prosecution they introduce both a\nstatement of facts, as if they were speaking first, and a\nrefutation of the arguments for the defence, as if\nthey were replying and they are right in so doing.\nFor since declamation is merely an exercise in forensic\npleading, why should they not qualify themselves to speak either first or second Those however who\ndo not understand the reason for such a practice,\nthink that when they appear in the courts they\nshould stick to the custom of the schools with which\nthey have become familiar. But even scholastic\nrhetoricians occasionally substitute a brief summary\nfor the full statement of the facts. For what statement of the case can be made when a wife is accusing\na jealous husband of maltreating her, or a father is\nindicting his son turned Cynic before the censors\nfor indecent behaviour In both cases the charge\ncan be sufficiently indicated by one word placed\nin any part of the speech. But enough of these\npoints. I will now proceed to the method to be adopted\nin making our statement of facts. The statement of\nfacts consists in the persuasive exposition of that\nwhich either has been done, or is supposed to\nhave been done, or, to quote the definition given by\nApollodorus, is a speech instructing the audience as to\nthe nature of the case in dispute. Most writers, more\nespecially those of the Isocratean school, hold that\nit should be lucid, brief and plausible for it is of\nno importance if we substitute clear for lucid, or\ncredible or probable for plausible. I agree with\nthis classification of its qualities, although Aristotle\ndisagrees with Isocrates on one point, and pours\nscorn on his injunction to be brief, as though it\nwere necessary that a statement should be either\nlong or short and it were impossible to hit the happy\nmean. The followers of Theodorus on the other\nhand recognise only plausibility on the ground\nthat it is not always expedient that our exposition\nshould be either short or clear. It will be necessary therefore for me to devote some care to the differentiation of the various features of this portion of a\nspeech, in order that I may show under what\ncircumstances each is specially useful. The statement will be either wholly in our favour\nor wholly in that of our opponent or a mixture of\nboth. If it is entirely in our own favour, we may\nrest content with the three qualities just mentioned,\nthe result of which is to make it easier for the judge\nto understand, remember and believe what we say.\nNow I should regret that anyone should censure my\nconduct in suggesting that a statement which is\nwholly in our favour should be plausible, when as\na matter of fact it is true. There are many things\nwhich are true, but scarcely credible, just as there\nare many things which are plausible though false.\nIt will therefore require just as much exertion on\nour part to make the judge believe what we say\nwhen it is true as it will when it is fictitious. These\ngood qualities, which I have mentioned above, do\nnot indeed cease to be virtues in other portions of the\nspeech; for it is our duty to avoid obscurity in every\npart of our pleading, to preserve due proportion\nthroughout and to say nothing save what is likely\nto win belief. But they require special observance\nin that portion of the speech which is the first\nfrom which the judge can learn the nature of the\ncase if at this stage of the proceedings he fails to\nunderstand, remember or believe what we say, our\nlabour is but lost in the remainder of the speech. We shall achieve lucidity and clearness in our\nstatement of facts, first by setting forth our story in\nwords which are appropriate, significant and free\nfrom any taint of meanness, but not on the other hand farfetched or unusual, and secondly by giving\na distinct account of facts, persons, times, places and\ncauses, while our delivery must be adapted to our\nmatter, so that the judge will take in what we say\nwith the utmost readiness. This latter virtue is\ndisregarded by the majority of speakers who are\nused to the noisy applause of a large audience,\nwhether it be a chance gathering or an assembly of\nclaqueurs, and consequently are unnerved by the\nattentive silence of the courts. They feel that they\nhave fallen short of eloquence, if they do not make\neverything echo with noise and clamour; they think\nthat to state a matter simply is suited only to everyday speech such as falls within the capacity of any\nuneducated man, while all the time it is hard to say\nwhether they are less willing or less capable of\nperforming a task which they despise on account of\nits supposed easiness. For even when they have\ntried everything, they will never find anything more\ndifficult in the whole range of oratory than that\nwhich, once heard, all think they would have said,\na delusion due to the fact that they regard what has\nbeen said as having no merit save that of truth. But\nit is just when an orator gives the impression of\nabsolute truth that he is speaking best. As it is,\nwhen such persons as these get a fair field for stating their case, they select this as the precise occasion\nfor affected modulations of the voice, throwing back\ntheir heads, thumping their sides and indulging in\nevery kind of extravagance of statement, language\nand style. As a result, while the speech, from its\nvery monstrosity, meets with applause, the case\nremains unintelligible. However, let us pass to\nanother subject; my aim is to win favour for pointing out the right road rather than to give\noffence by rebuking such perversity. The statement of facts will be brief, if in the first\nplace we start at that point of the case at which it\nbegins to concern the judge, secondly avoid irrelevance, and finally cut out everything the removal\nof which neither hampers the activities of the judge\nnor harms our own case. For frequently conciseness\nof detail is not inconsistent with length in the\nwhole. Take for instance such a statement as the\nfollowing Nothing could be terser\nthan these assertions, but it would have been quite\nsufficient to say And\nwhenever the conclusion gives a sufficiently clear\nidea of the premisses, we must be content with\nhaving given a hint which will enable our audience\nto understand what we have left unsaid. Consequently when it is possible to say it is quite superfluous to say, For this reason some of the Greeks draw a\ndistinction between a concise statement the word\nthey use is  and a brief statement, the\nformer being free from all superfluous matter, while\nthe latter may conceivably omit something that\nrequires to be stated. Personally, when I use the\nword brevity, I mean not saying less, but not saying\nmore than occasion demands. As for repetitions\nand tautologies and diffuseness, which some writers\nof textbooks tell us we must avoid, I pass them by; they are faults which we should shun for other reasons\nbeside our desire for brevity. But we must be\nequally on our guard against the obscurity which\nresults from excessive abridgment, and it is better to\nsay a little more than is necessary than a little less.\nFor though a diffuse irrelevance is tedious, the\nomission of what is necessary is positively dangerous.\nWe must therefore avoid even tile famous terseness\nof Sallust though in his case of course it is a merit,\nand shun all abruptness of speech, since a style\nwhich presents no difficulty to a leisurely reader,\nflies past a hearer and will not stay to be\nlooked at again; and whereas the reader is\nalmost always a man of learning, the judge often\ncomes to his panel from the country side and is\nexpected to give a decision on what he can understand. Consequently we must aim, perhaps everywhere, but above all in our statement of facts, at\nstriking the happy mean in our language, and the\nhappy mean may be defined as saving just what\nis necessary and just what is sufficient. By I mean not the bare minimum\nnecessary to convey our meaning; for our brevity\nmust not be devoid of elegance, without which it\nwould be merely uncouth pleasure beguiles the\nattention, and that which delights us ever seems less\nlong, just as a picturesque and easy journey tires us\nless for all its length than a difficult short cut through\nan arid waste. And I would never carry my desire\nfor brevity so far as to refuse admission to details\nwhich may contribute to the plausibility of our\nnarrative. Simplify and curtail your statement of\nfacts in every direction and you will turn it into\nsomething more like a confession. Moreover, the circumstances of the case will often necessitate a\nlong statement of facts, in which case, as I have\nalready enjoined, the judge should be prepared for\nit at the conclusion of the exordium. Next we must\nput forth all our art either to shorten it or to render\nit less tedious. We must do what we can to make\nit less long by postponing some points, taking care\nhowever to mention what it is that we propose to\npostpone. Take the following as an example. Some\nthings indeed may be omitted altogether from our\nmarshalling of the facts, witness the following\nexample from Cicero, Division of our statement into its various\nheads is another method of avoiding tedium for\nexample, Such a\ndivision will give the impression of three short statements rather than of one long one. At times it will be\nwell to interrupt our narrative by interjecting some\nbrief remark like the following The\njudge will be refreshed by the fact that we have\nbrought our previous remarks to a close and will\nprepare himself for what may be regarded as a fresh\nstart. If however after employing all these artifices\nour array of facts is still long, it will not be without\nadvantage to append a summary at the end of it as\na reminder Cicero does this even at the close of a brief statement of facts in the pro Ligario The statement of fact will be credible, if in the first\nplace we take care to say nothing contrary to nature,\nsecondly if we assign reasons and motives for the\nfacts on which the inquiry turns it is unnecessary to\ndo so with the subsidiary facts as well, and if we\nmake the characters of the actors in keeping with\nthe facts we desire to be believed we shall for\ninstance represent a person accused of theft as\ncovetous, accused of adultery as lustful, accused of\nhomicide as rash, or attribute the opposite qualities\nto these persons if we are defending them further\nwe must do the same with place, time and the like.\nIt is also possible to treat the subject in such a way\nas to give it an air of credibility, as is done in\ncomedy and farce. For some things have such natural\nsequence and coherence that, if only the first\nportion of your statement is satisfactory, the judge\nwill himself anticipate what you have got to\nsay in the later part. It will also be useful to\nscatter some hints of our proofs here and there, but\nin such a way that it is never forgotten that we are\nmaking a statement of facts and not a proof. Sometimes, however, we must also support our assertions\nby a certain amount of argument, though this must\nbe short and simple for instance in a case of\npoisoning we shall say, The same result is produced by preparatory remarks such as the following We may in fact touch on everything that we\npropose to produce in our proof; while making our\nstatement of facts, as for instance points connected\nwith persons, cause, place, time, the instrument and\noccasion employed. Sometimes, when this resource\nis unavailable, we may even confess that the charge,\nthough true, is scarcely credible, and that therefore\nit must be regarded as all the more atrocious; that\nwe do not know how the deed was done or why, that\nwe are filled with amazement, but will prove our\ncase. The best kind of preparatory remarks are\nthose which cannot be recognised as such Cicero,\nfor instance, is extraordinarily happy in the way he\nmentions in advance everything that shows that\nClodius lay in wait for Milo and not Milo for Clodius.\nThe most effective stroke of all is his cunning feint\nof simplicity What an absence of haste\nand premeditation this gives to Milo's proceedings.\nAnd the great orator secures this effect not merely\nby producing facts which indicate the slow and\ntardy nature of Milo's departure, but by the use of\nthe ordinary language of everyday speech and a\ncareful concealment of his art. Had he spoken\notherwise, his words would by their very sound have\nwarned the judge to keep an eye on the advocate.\nThe majority of readers regard this passage as lacking in distinction, but this very fact merely serves to show how the art which is scarce detected by a\nreader succeeded in hoodwinking the judge. It is\nqualities of this kind that make the statement of facts\ncredible. If a student requires to be told that we\nmust avoid contradiction and inconsistency in our\nstatement of facts, it will be vain to attempt to instruct\nhim on the remaining points, although some writers\nof text-books produce this precept as if it were a\nmystery only discovered by their own personal\npenetration. To these three qualities some add magnificence of\ndiction or as they call it this quality\nis not, however, suitable to all cases. For what place\nhas language that rises above the ordinary level in\nthe majority of private suits dealing with loans,\nletting and hiring and interdicts Nor yet is it\nalways expedient, as may be inferred from the\npassage just cited from the pro Milone. We must\nremember, too, that there are many cases in which\nconfession, excuse or modification are necessary with\nregard to our statements and magnificence is a\nquality wholly out of keeping with such procedure.\nMagnificence of diction is therefore no more specially\nappropriate to the statement of facts than language\ncalculated to excite pity or hatred, or characterised\nby dignity, charm or wit. Each of these qualities\nis admirable in its proper place, but none can be\nregarded as the peculiar and inalienable property of\nthis portion of the speech. Theodectes asserts that the statement of facts\nshould not merely be magnificent, but attractive\nin style. But this quality again though suitable\nenough to the statement of facts, is equally so in\nother portions of the speech. There are others who add palpability, which the Greeks call And I will not conceal the fact that Cicero himself\nholds that more qualities are required. For in\naddition to demanding that it should be plain, brief\nand credible, he would have it clear, characteristic\nand worthy of the occasion. But everything in\na speech should be characteristic and worthy of the\noccasion as far as possible. Palpalility, as far\nas I understand the term, is no doubt a great virtue,\nwhen a truth requires not merely to be told, but to\nsome extent obtruded, still it may be included under\nlucidity. Some, however, regard this quality as\nactually being injurious at times, on the ground that\nin certain cases it is desirable to obscure the truth.\nThis contention is, however, absurd. For he who\ndesires to obscure the situation, will state what is\nfalse in lieu of the truth, but must still strive to\nsecure an appearance of palpability for the facts\nwhich he narrates. A chance turn of the discussion has led us to a\ndifficult type of statement of facts. I will therefore\nproceed to speak of those in which the facts are\nagainst us. Under such circumstances some have\nheld that we should omit the statement of facts\naltogether. Nothing can be more easy, except\nperhaps to throw up the case altogether. But\nsuppose you undertake a case of this kind with\nsome good reason. It is surely the worst art to\nadmit the badness of the case by keeping silence.\nWe can hardly hope that the judge will be so\ndense as to give a decision in favour of a case which\nhe knows we were unwilling to place before him.\nI do not of course deny that just as there may be\nsome points which you should deny in your statement of facts, others which you should add, and yet again\nothers that you should alter, so there may be some\nwhich you should pass over in silence. But still\nonly those points should be passed over which we\nought and are at liberty to treat in this way. This\nis sometimes done for the sake of brevity, as in the\nphrase We\nmust therefore distinguish between case and case.\nIn those where there is no question of guilt but\nonly of law, we may, even though the facts he\nagainst us, admit the truth. But even in making these admissions we may to some extent lessen the odium\ncaused by the statement of our opponent. For even\nour slaves extenuate their own faults. In some\ncases, too, we may mitigate a bad impression by\nwords which avoid the appearance of a statement of\nfacts. We may say, for instance, Again we may\nsometimes go near condemning our client ourselves. Sometimes we may fortify our case in advance by a\npreliminary summary, from which we proceed to the\nfull statement of facts. All the evidence points to\nthe guilt of three sons who had conspired against\ntheir father. After drawing lots they entered\ntheir father's bedroom while he slept, one following\nthe other in the order predetermined and each\narmed with a sword. None of them had the heart\nto kill him, he woke and they confessed all. If,\nhowever, the father, who has divided his estate\namong them and is defending them when accused\nof parricide, pleads as follows And if he then should\nadd, If such were his pleading, all these pleas would,\nsuch as they are, find the judges all the more\ndisposed to mercy, since the brief defence offered\nin the first summary statement would have paved\nthe way for them. But if the question is whether\nan act has been committed or what its nature may\nbe, even though everything be against us, how can\nwe avoid a statement of facts without gross neglect\nof our case The accuser has made a statement of facts\nfacts, and has done so not merely in such a way as\nto indicate what was done, but has added such\ncomments as might excite strong prejudice against\nus and made the facts seem worse than they are\nby the language which he has used. On the top\nof this have come the proofs, while the peroration\nhas kindled the indignation of the judges and left\nthem full of anger against us. The judge naturally\nwaits to hear what we can state in our behalf. If\nwe make no statement, he cannot help believing\nthat our opponent's assertions are correct and that\ntheir tone represents the truth. What are we to\ndo then Are we to restate the same facts Yes,\nif the question turns on the nature of the act, as\nit will if there is no doubt about the commission,\nbut we must restate them in a different way,\nalleging other motives and another purpose and\nputting a different complexion on the case. Some\nimputations we may mitigate by the use of other\nwords; luxury will be softened down into generosity, avarice into economy, carelessness into simplicity,\nand I shall seek to win a certain amount of favour\nor pity by look, voice and attitude. Sometimes a\nfrank confession is of itself sufficient to move the\njury to tears. And I should like to ask those who\ndiffer from me whether they are prepared to defend\nwhat they have refused to state, or no. For if\nthey refuse either to defend or to state the facts,\nthey will be giving away their whole case. If, on\nthe other hand, they do propose to put in a defence,\nthey must at least, as a rule, set forth what they\nintend to justify. Why then not state fully facts\nwhich can be got rid of and must in fact be pointed\nout to make that possible Or again what\ndifference is there between a proof and a statement\nof facts save that the latter is a proof put forward\nin continuous form, while a proof is a verification\nof the facts as put forward in the statement Let\nus consider therefore whether under such circumstances the statement should not be somewhat\nlonger and fuller than usual, since we shall require\nto make some preliminary remarks and to introduce\ncertain special arguments note that I say arguments,\nand not argumentation, while it will add greatly\nto the force of our defence if we assert not once\nnor twice that we shall prove what we say is true\nand that the significance of the facts cannot be\nbrought out by one opening statement, bidding them\nwait, delay forming their opinions and hope for the\nbest. Finally it is important to include in our\nstatement anything that can be given a different\ncomplexion from that put upon it by our opponent.\nOtherwise even an exordium will be superfluous\nin a case of this kind. For what is its purpose if not to make the judge better disposed for the\ninvestigation of the case And yet it will be\nagreed that the exordium is never more useful than\nwhen it is necessary to divert the judge from some\nprejudice that he has formed against us. Conjectural cases, on the other handthat is to say\nquestions of factrequire a statement, which will\nmore often deal with the circumstances from which\na knowledge of the point at issue may be derived\nthan with the actual point which is under trial.\nWhen the accuser states these circumstances in\nsuch a manner as to throw suspicion on the case for\nthe defence, and the accused has consequently to\ndispel that suspicion, the facts must be presented to\nthe judge in quite a different light by the latter. But,\nit may be urged, some arguments are strong when put\nforward in bulk, but far less effective when employed\nseparately. My answer is that this remark does not\naffect the question whether we ought to make a\nstatement of fact, but concerns the question how it\nshould be made. For what is there to prevent us\nfrom amassing and producing a number of arguments\nin the statement, if that is likely to help our cause\nOr from subdividing our statement of facts and\nappending the proofs to their respective sections\nand so passing on to what remains to be said\nNeither do I agree with those who assert that\nthe order of our statement of facts should always\nfollow the actual order of events, but have a preference for adopting the order which I consider\nmost suitable. For this purpose we can employ a\nvariety of figures. Sometimes, when we bring up\na point in a place better suited to our purpose,\nwe may pretend that it had escaped our notice; occasionally, too, we may inform the judge that we\nshall adhere to the natural order for the remainder\nof our statement, since by so doing we shall make\nour case clearer, while at times after stating a fact,\nwe may append the causes which preceded it. For\nthere is no single law or fixed rule governing the\nmethod of defence. We must consider what is\nmost advantageous in the circumstances and nature\nof the case, and treat the wound as its nature\ndictates, dressing at once or, if the dressing can be\ndelayed, applying a temporary bandage. Again I\ndo not regard it as a crime to repeat a statement of\na fact more than once, as Cicero does in the pro\nCluentio. It is not merely permissible, but sometimes necessary, as in trials for extortion and all\ncomplicated cases; and only a lunatic will allow a\nsuperstitious observance of rules to lead him counter\nto the interests of his case. The reason for placing\nthe statement of facts before the proof is to prevent\nthe judge from being ignorant of the question at\nissue. Why then, if each individual point has to be\nproved or refuted, should not each individual point be\nstated as well If my own experience may be\ntrusted, I know that I have followed this practice in\nthe courts, whenever occasion demanded it, and my\nprocedure has been approved both by learned authorities and the judges themselves, while the duty of\nsetting forth the case was generally entrusted to me.\nI am not boasting, for there are many with whom I\nhave been associated as counsel, who can bring me to\nbook if I lie. On the other hand this is no reason\nfor not following the order of events as a general rule.\nIndeed inversion of the order has at times a most\nunhappy effect, as for example if you should mention first that a woman has brought forth and then that\nshe has conceived, or that a will has been read and\nthen that it has been signed. In such cases, if you\nshould happen to have mentioned the later incident,\nit is better to say nothing about the former, which\nmust quite obviously have come first. Sometimes, too, we get false statements of facts;\nthese, as far as actual pleading in the courts is concerned, fall into two classes. In the first case the statement depends on external support; Publius Clodius,\nfor instance, relied on his witnesses when he stated\nthat he was at Interamna on the night when he committed abominable sacrilege at Rome. The other has\nto be supported by the speaker's native talent, and\nsometimes consists simply in an assumption of modesty,\nwhich is, I imagine, the reason why it is called a\ngloss, while at other times it will be concerned with\nthe question at issue. Whichever of these two forms\nwe employ, we must take care, first that our fiction\nis within the bounds of possibility, secondly that it\nis consistent with the persons, dates and places involved and thirdly that it presents a character and\nsequence that are not beyond belief if possible,\nit should be connected with something that is\nadmittedly true and should be supported by some\nargument that forms part of the actual case. For if\nwe draw our fictions entirely from circumstances\nlying outside the case, the liberty which we have\ntaken in resorting to falsehood will stand revealed.\nAbove all we must see that we do not contradict\nourselves, a slip which is far from rare on the part of\nspinners of fiction for some things may put a most\nfavourable complexion on portions of our case, and\nyet fail to agree as a whole. Further, what we say must not be at variance with the admitted truth. Even\nin the schools, if we desire a gloss, we must not look\nfor it outside the facts laid down by our theme. In\neither case the orator should bear clearly in mind\nthroughout his whole speech what the fiction is to\nwhich he has committed himself, since we are apt to\nforget our falsehoods, and there is no doubt about the\ntruth of the proverb that a liar should have a good\nmemory. But whereas, if the question turns on some\nact of our own, we must make one statement and\nstick to it, if it turns on an act committed by others,\nwe may cast suspicion on a number of different\npoints. In certain controversial themes of the schools,\nhowever, in which it is assumed that we have put a\nquestion and received no reply, we are at liberty to\nenumerate all the possible answers that might have\nbeen given. But we must remember only to invent\nsuch things as cannot be checked by evidence I\nrefer to occasions when we make our own minds\nspeak and we are the only persons who are in their\nsecret or put words in the mouth of the dead for\nwhat they say is not liable to contradiction or\nagain in the mouth of someone whose interests are\nidentical with ours for he will not contradict, or\nfinally in the mouth of our opponent for he will not\nbe believed if he does deny. Glosses drawn from\ndreams and superstitions have long since lost their\nvalue, owing to the very ease with which they can\nbe invented. But it will avail us little to use glosses\nin a statement of fact, unless they are consistent\nthroughout the whole of our speech, more especially\nas certain things can only be proved by persistent\nassertion. Take for instance the case of the parasite\nwho claims as his son a young man who has been thrice disinherited by a wealthy father and thrice\nrestored to his own. He will be able to put forward\nas a gloss or plea that poverty was the reason why he\nexposed the child, that he assumed the role of a\nparasite because his son was in the house in question\nand, lastly, that the reason why the young man was\nthrice disinherited was simply that he was not the\nson of the man who disinherited him. But unless\nevery word that he utters reveals an ardent paternal\naffection, hatred for his wealthy opponent and\nanxiety on behalf of the youth, who will, he knows,\nbe exposed to serious danger if he remains in the\nhouse where he is the victim of such dislike, he will\nbe unable to avoid creating the suspicion that he\nhas been suborned to bring the action. It sometimes happens in the controversial themes\nof the schools, though I doubt whether it could ever\noccur in the courts, that both sides employ the same\ngloss and support it on their own behalf. An\nexample of this may be found in the theme which\nruns as follows. No defence\ncan be put forward for the son which is not also a\ndefence of the stepmother. However, what is common to both sides of the case will be stated, and\nthen arguments will be drawn from a comparison of the characters of the two parties, from the order in\nwhich they laid information against each other and\nfrom the silence of the divorced wife. Still we\nmust not ignore the fact that there are some cases\nwhich do not admit of any form of gloss, but must\nbe defended forthright. An example is provided by\nthe case of the rich man who scourged the statue\nof a poor man who was his enemy, and was subsequently indicted for assault. Here no one can deny\nthat the act was outrageous, but it may be possible\nto maintain that it is not punishable by law. If, however, part of the statement of facts tells in\nour favour and part against us, we must consider\nwhether in view of the circumstances of the case\nthe parts in question should be blent or kept\napart. If the points which are damaging to our\ncase be in the majority, the points which are in\nits favour will be swamped. Under those circumstances it will be best to keep them apart and, after\nsetting forth and proving the points which help our\ncase, to meet the rest by employing the remedies\nmentioned above. If, on the other hand, it be the\npoints in our favour which predominate, we may\neven blend them with the others, since thus the\ntraitors in our camp will have less force. None the\nless these points, both good and bad, must not be set\nforth naked and helpless those in our favour must\nbe supported by some argument, and then reasons\nmust be added why the points which tell against\nus should not be believed; since if we do not distinguish clearly between the two, it is to be feared\nthat those which are favourable may suffer from\ntheir bad company. Further rules are laid down with regard to the statement of fact, forbidding us to indulge in\ndigression, apostrophe or argumentation or to put\nour words into the mouths of others. Some even\nadd that we should make no appeal to the passions.\nThese rules should for the most part be observed,\nindeed they should never be infringed unless the\ncircumstances absolutely demand it. If our statement is to be clear and brief, almost anything can\nbe justified sooner than digression. And if we do\nintroduce a digression, it must always be short and\nof such a nature that we give the impression of\nhaving been forced from our proper course by\nsome uncontrollable emotion. The passage in\nCicero about the marriage of Sasia is a good example of this. As to addressing another in place of\nthe judge, it may be a means of making a point with\ngreater brevity and give it greater force. On this\nsubject I hold the same view that I expressed in\ndealing with the exordium, as I do on the subject of\nimpersonation. This artifice however is employed not\nonly by Servius Sulpicius in his speech on behalf of\nAufidia, when he cries but by Cicero as well, when in a\npassage which, like the above, belongs to the statement of facts, in speaking of the ships' captains he\nsays, Again\nin the pro Clueniio does not the conversation\nbetween Staienus and Bulbus conduce to speed and\nenhance the credibility of the statements  In\ncase it should be thought that Cicero did this\nwithout design quite an incredible supposition in\nhis case, I would point out that in the Partitiones\nhe lays it down that the statement of facts should\nbe characterised by passages which will charm and\nexcite admiration or expectation, and marked by\nunexpected turns, conversations between persons and\nappeals to every kind of emotion. We shall, as I\nhave already said, never argue points in the statement of facts, but we may sometimes introduce\narguments, as for example Cicero does in the pro\nLigario, when he says that he ruled his province in\nsuch a way that it was to his interest that peace\nshould continue. We shall sometimes also, if\noccasion demand, insert a brief defence of the facts\nin the statement and trace the reasons that led up\nto them. For we must state our facts like advocates,\nnot witnesses. A statement in its simplest form\nwill run as follows, But how will Cicero put\nit  he says, And again elsewhere\nhe says, And when the\nsense would have been sufficiently clear had he said no more than he adds Thus he made\nwhat he stated credible by giving a reason for it\nand at the same time coloured it with emotion. I am therefore all the more surprised at those\nwho hold that there should be no appeal to the\nemotions in the statement of facts. If they were to\nsay I should agree with them; for it is important that\nthe statement should be expeditious. But why,\nwhile I am instructing the judge, should I refuse to\nmove him as well Why should I not, if it is\npossible, obtain that effect at the very opening of\nthe case which I am anxious to secure at its conclusion, more especially in view of the fact that I\nshall find the judge far more amenable to the\ncogency of my proof, if I have previously filled his\nmind with anger or pity Does not Cicero, in his\ndescription of the scourging of a Roman citizen, in a\nfew brief words stir all the emotions, not merely by\ndescribing the victim's position, the place where the\noutrage was committed and the nature of the\npunishment, but also by praising the courage with\nwhich he bore it For he shows us a man of the\nhighest character who, when beaten with rods,\nuttered not a moan nor an entreaty, but only cried\nthat lie was a Roman citizen, thereby bringing\nshame on his oppressor and showing his confidence\nin the law. Again does he not throughout the\nwhole of his statement excite the warmest indignation at the misfortunes of Philodamus and move us even to tears when he speaks of his punishment\nand describes, or rather shows us as in a picture,\nthe father weeping for the death of his son and the\nson for the death of his father What can any\nperoration present that is more calculated to stir\nour pity If you wait for the peroration to stir your\nhearer's emotions over circumstances which you\nhave recorded unmoved in your statement of facts,\nyour appeal will come too late. The judge is\nalready familiar with them and hears their mention\nwithout turning a hair, since he was unstirred when\nthey were first recounted to him. Once the habit\nof mind is formed, it is hard to change it. For my own part for I will not conceal my\nopinion, though it rests rather on actual examples\nthan on rules, I hold that the statement of fact more\nthan any portion of the speech should be adorned\nwith the utmost grace and charm. But much will\ndepend on the nature of the subject which we have\nto set forth. In slighter cases, such as are the\nmajority of private suits, the decoration must be\nrestrained and fit close to the subject, while the\nutmost care must be exercised in choice of words.\nThe words which in our purple passages are swept\nalong by the force of our eloquence and lost in the\nprofusion of our language, must in cases such as\nthese be clear and, as Zeno says, The rhythm should be unobtrusive, but as\nattractive as possible, while the figures must neither\nbe derived from poetry nor such as are contrary to\ncurrent usage, though warranted by the authority of\nantiquity for it is important that our language should\nbe entirely normal, but should be designed to relieve\ntedium by their variety and should be frequently changed to relax the strain of attention. Thus we\nshall avoid repeating the same terminations and\nescape monotony of rhythm and a stereotyped turn\nof phrase. For the statement of facts lacks all the\nother allurements of style and, unless it is characterised by this kind of charm, will necessarily fall flat.\nMoreover there is no portion of a speech at which\nthe judge is more attentive, and consequently nothing\nthat is well said is lost. And the judge is, for some\nreason or other, all the more ready to accept what\ncharms his ear and is lured by pleasure to belief.\nWhen on the other hand the subject is on a larger\nscale, we have a chance to excite horror by our\nnarration of abominable wrongs or pity by a tale\nof woe but we must do so in such a way as not to\nexhaust our stock of emotions on the spot, but\nmerely to indicate our harrowing story in outline so\nthat it may at once be clear what the completed\npicture is like to be. Again I am far from disapproving of the introduction of some striking\nsentence designed to stimulate the judge's jaded\npalate. The best way of so doing is the interposition of a short sentence like the following\n at times we may even be a little more\ndaring and produce something like the following If this was\ndone in days when every speech was designed for\npractical purposes rather than display and the courts\nwere far stricter than to-day, how much more should\nwe do it now, when the passion for producing a thrill of pleasure has forced its way even into cases\nwhere a man's life or fortunes are in peril I shall\nsay later to what extent I think we should indulge\npopular taste in this respect in the meantime I\nshall admit that some such indulgence is necessary.\nA powerful effect may be created if to the actual\nfacts of the case we add a plausible picture of what\noccurred, such as will make our audience feel as if\nthey were actual eyewitnesses of the scene. Such\nis the description introduced by Marcus Caelius in\nhis speech against Antonius. Could\nyou find anything more plausible in imagination, more\nvehement in censure or more vivid in description There is another point to which I must call attention, namely the credit which accrues to the statement\nof facts from the authority of the speaker. Now\nsuch authority should first and foremost be the reward of our manner of life, but may also be conferred by our style of eloquence. For the more dignified\nand serious our style, the greater will be the weight\nthat it will lend to our assertions. It is therefore\nspecially important in this part of our speech to avoid\nanything suggestive of artful design, for the judge is\nnever more on his guard than at this stage. Nothing\nmust seem fictitious, nought betray anxiety; everything must seem to spring from the case itself rather\nthan the art of the orator. But our modern orators\ncannot endure this and imagine that their art is\nwasted unless it obtrudes itself, whereas as a matter\nof fact the moment it is detected it ceases to be art.\nWe are the slaves of applause and think it the goal\nof all our effort. And so we betray to the judges\nwhat we wish to display to the bystanders. There is also a kind of repetition of the statement\nwhich the Greeks call It belongs to\ndeclamation rather than forensic oratory, and was invented to enable the speaker in view of the fact that\nthe statement should be brief to set forth his facts\nat greater length and with more profusion of ornament, as a means of exciting indignation or pity. I\nthink that this should be done but rarely and that\nwe should never go to the extent of repeating the\nstatement in its entirety. For we can attain the same\nresult by a repetition only of parts. Anyone, however, who desires to employ this form of repetition,\nshould touch but lightly on the facts when making\nhis statement and should content himself with merely\nindicating what was done, while promising to set\nforth how it was done more fully when the time\ncomes for it. Some hold that the statement of facts should always\nbegin by referring to some person, whom we must praise if he is on our side, and abuse if he is on the\nside of our opponents. It is true that this is very\noften done for the good reason that a law-suit must\ntake place between persons. Persons may however\nalso be introduced with all their attendant circumstances, if such a procedure is likely to prove useful.\nFor instance, Or again they may be introduced without such circumstances, as in the\npassage beginning Often, too, we may commence with a fact as Cicero\ndoes in the pro Tullio or Demosthenes in the speech in defence of Ctesiphonl, As regards the conclusion of the statement of facts,\nthere is a controversy with those who would have\nthe statement end where the issue to be determined\nbegins. Here is an example. This rule\ncan always be observed by the prosecutor, but not\nalways by the defendant. III. In the natural order of things the statement of fact is followed by the verification. For it is necessary to prove the points which we stated\nwith the proof in view. But before I enter on this\nportion, I have a few words to say on the opinions\nheld by certain rhetoricians. Most of them are in\nthe habit, as soon as they have completed the statement of facts, of digressing to some pleasant and\nattractive topic with a view to securing the utmost\namount of favour from their audience. This practice\noriginated in the display of the schools of declaration and thence extended to the courts as soon as\ncauses came to be pleaded, not for the benefit of the\nparties concerned, but to enable the advocates to\nflaunt their talents. I imagine that they feared that\nif the slender stream of concise statement, such as is\ngenerally required, were followed by the pugnacious\ntone inevitable in the arguing of the case, the speech\nwould fall flat owing to the postponement of the\npleasures of a more expansive eloquence. The objection to this practice lies in the fact that they do\nthis without the slightest consideration of the\ndifference between case and case or reflecting\nwhether what they are doing will in any way assist\nthem, on the assumption that it is always expedient\nand always necessary. Consequently they transfer\nstriking thoughts from the places which they should\nhave occupied elsewhere and concentrate them in\nthis portion of the speech, a practice which involves\neither the repetition of a number of things that they\nhave already said or their omission from the place\nwhich was really theirs owing to the fact that they\nhave already been said. I admit however that this\nform of digression can be advantageously appended,\nnot merely to the statement of facts, but to each of\nthe different questions or to the questions as a whole, so long as the case demand, or at any rate permit it.\nIndeed such a practice confers great distinction and\nadornment on a speech, but only if the digression\nfits in well with the rest of the speech and follows\nnaturally on what has preceded, not if it is thrust in\nlike a wedge parting what should naturally come\ntogether. For there is no part of a speech so closely\nconnected with any other as the statement with the\nproof, though of course such a digression may be\nintended as the conclusion of the statement and the\nbeginning of the proof There will therefore sometimes be room for digression; for example if the end\nof the statement has been concerned with some specially horrible theme, we may embroider the theme\nas though our indignation must find immediate\nvent. This, however, should only be done if\nthere is no question about the facts. Otherwise it is more important to verify your charge than\nto heighten it, since the horrible nature of a charge\nis in favour of the accused, until the charge is\nproved. For it is just the most flagrant crimes that\nare the most difficult to prove. Again a digression\nmay be advantageous if after setting forth the services\nrendered by your client to his opponent you denounce\nthe latter for his ingratitude, or after producing a\nvariety of charges in your statement, you point out\nthe serious danger in which the advancement of such\ncharges is likely to involve you. But all these digressions should be brief. For as soon as he has\nheard the facts set forth in order, the judge is in a\nhurry to get to the proof and desires to satisfy himself of the correctness of his impressions at the\nearliest possible moment. Further, care must be\ntaken not to nullify the effect of the statement by diverting the minds of the court to some other theme\nand wearying them by useless delay. But, though such digressions are not always necessary at the end of the statement, they may form a very\nuseful preparation for the examination of the main\nquestion, more especially if at first sight it presents\nan aspect unfavourable to our case, if we have to\nsupport a harsh law or demand severe punishment.\nFor this is the place for inserting what may be\nregarded as a second exordium with a view to\nexciting or mollifying the judge or disposing him\nto lend a favouring ear to our proofs. Moreover we can do this with all the greater freedom\nand vehemence at this stage of the proceedings\nsince the case is already known to the judge. We\nshall therefore employ such utterances as emollients to soften the harder elements of our statement, in order that the ears of the jury may be\nmore ready to take in what we have to say in the\nsequel and to grant us the justice which we ask.\nFor it is hard to persuade a man to do anything\nagainst the grain. It is also important on such\noccasions to know whether the judge prefers equity\nor a strict interpretation of the law, since the necessity for such digression will vary accordingly. Such passages may also serve as a kind of peroration after the main question. The Greeks call\nthis the Romans egressus or egressio\ndigression. They may however, as I have said,\nbe of various kinds and may deal with different\nthemes in any portion of the speech. For instance\nwe may extol persons or places, describe regions,\nrecord historical or even legendary occurrences. As\nexamples I may cite the praise of Sicily and the rape of Proserpine in the Verrines, or the famous recital of\nthe virtues of Gneius Pompeius in the pro Cornelio,\nwhere the great orator as though the course of his\neloquence had been broken by the mere mention of\nthe general's name, interrupts the topic on which he\nhad already embarked and digresses forthwith to sing\nhis praises. may, I think, be defined as the\nhandling of some theme, which must however have\nsome bearing on the case, in a passage that involves\ndigression from the logical order of our speech. I do\nnot see therefore why it should be assigned a special\nposition immediately following on the statement of\nfacts any more than I understand why they think\nthat the name is applicable only to a digression where\nsome statement has to be made, when there are so\nmany different ways in which a speech may leave\nthe direct route. For whatever we say that falls\noutside the five divisions of the speech already laid\ndown is a digression, whether it express indignation,\npity, hatred, rebuke, excuse, conciliation or be designed to rebut invective. Other similar occasions\nfor digression on points not involved by the question\nat issue arise when we amplify or abridge a topic,\nmake any kind of emotional appeal or introduce any\nof those topics which add such charm and elegance\nto oratory, topics that is to say such as luxury,\navarice, religion, duty but these would hardly\nseem to be digressions as they are so closely attached\nto arguments on similar subjects that they form part\nof the texture of the speech. There are however a\nnumber of topics which are inserted in the midst of\nmatter which has no connexion with them, when\nfor example we strive to excite, admonish, appease,\nentreat or praise the judge. Such passages are innumerable. Some will have been carefully prepared beforehand, while others will be produced to\nsuit the occasion or the necessity of the moment, if\nanything extraordinary should occur in the course of\nour pleading, such as an interruption, the intervention of some individual or a disturbance. For example,\nthis made it necessary for Cicero to digress even in\nthe exordium when he was defending Milo, as is\nclear from the short speech which he made on\nthat occasion. But the orator who makes some\npreface to the main question or proposes to\nfollow up his proofs with a passage designed to\ncommend them to the jury, may digress at some\nlength. On the other hand, if he breaks as say in\nthe middle of his speech, he should not be long in\nreturning to the point from which he departed. IV. After the statement of facts some place the\nproposition which they regard as forming a division\nof a forensic speech. I have already expressed\nmy opinion of this view. But it seems to me\nthat the beginning of every proof is a proposition,\nsuch as often occurs in the demonstration of the\nmain question and sometimes even in the enunciation\nof individual arguments, more especially of those\nwhich are called But for the moment\nI shall speak of the first kind. It is not always necessary to employ it. The nature of the main question\nis sometimes sufficiently clear without any proposition,\nespecially if the statement of facts ends exactly where\nthe question begins. Consequently the recapitulation generally employed in the case of arguments is\nsometimes placed immediately after the statement\nof facts. Sometimes proposition is highly advantageous, more\nespecially when the fact cannot be defended and\nthe question turns on the definition of the fact;\nas for example in the case of the man who has taken\nthe money of a private individual from a temple we\nshall say, so\nthat the judge may understand that his sole duty is\nto decide whether the charge is tantamount to\nsacrilege. The same method may be employed\nin obscure or complicated cases, not merely to make\nthe case clearer, but sometimes also to make it more\nmoving. This effect will be produced, if we at once\nsupport our pleading with some such words as the\nfollowing For this proposition forces a confession upon our opponent and to a certain extent\naccelerates the decision of the court. It does more\nthan indicate the question, it contributes to its\nsolution. Propositions may be single, double or manifold\nthis is due to more than one reason. For several\ncharges may be combined, as when Socrates was\naccused of corrupting the youth and of introducing\nnew superstitions; while single propositions may be\nmade up of a number of arguments, as for instance\nwhen Aeschines is accused of misconduct as an\nambassador on the ground that he lied, failed to carry out his instructions, wasted time and accepted\nbribes. The defence may also contain several propositions for instance against a claim for money we\nmay urge, These propositions can be multiplied at pleasure, but\nit is sufficient to give an indication of my meaning.\nIf propositions are put forward singly with the proofs\nappended, they will form several distinct propositions\nif they are combined, they fall under the head of\npartition. A proposition may also be put forward unsupported, as is generally done in conjectural cases Or it may be\naccompanied by a reason I In addition to these forms of\nproposition we can also introduce a proposition of our\nown, such as or may\nuse the proposition of our opponent, such as or\nfinally we may employ a proposition which is common\nto both sides, such as Sometimes we may even couple contradictory\npropositions, as for instance We may at times produce the effect of a proposition, even though it is not in itself a proposition, by\nadding after the statement of facts some phrase such\nas the following thereby reminding the\njudge to give special attention to the question and\ngiving him a fillip to emphasise the point that we\nhave finished the statement of facts and are beginning\nthe proof, so that when we start to verify our statements he may realise that he has reached a fresh stage\nwhere he must begin to listen with renewed attention. V. Partition may be defined as the enumeration in\norder of our own propositions, those of our adversary\nor both. It is held by some that this is indispensable on the ground that it makes the case clearer\nand the judge more attentive and more ready to be\ninstructed, if he knows what we are speaking about\nand what we are going subsequently to speak about.\nOthers, on the contrary, think that such a course is\ndangerous to the speaker on two grounds, namely\nthat sometimes we may forget to perform what we\nhave promised and may, on the other hand, come\nupon something which we have omitted in the partition. But this will never happen to anyone unless\nhe is either a fool or has come into court without\nthinking out his speech in detail beforehand. Besides, what can be simpler or clearer than a straightforward partition  It follows nature as a guide and\nthe adhesion to a definite method is actually of the\ngreatest assistance to the speaker's memory. Therefore I cannot approve the view even of those who\nlay down that partition should not extend beyond\nthe length of three propositions. No doubt there is\na danger, if our partition is too complicated, that it may slip the memory of the judge and disturb his\nattention. But that is no reason why it should be\ntied down to a definite number of propositions, since\nthe case may quite conceivably require more. There\nare further reasons why we should sometimes dispense with partition. In the first place there are\nmany points which can be produced in a more\nattractive manner, if they appear to be discovered on\nthe spot and not to have been brought ready made\nfrom our study, but rather to have sprung from the\nrequirements of the case itself while we were speaking. Thus we get those not unpleasing figures such\nas or For if we set forth\nall that we propose to prove in advance, we shall\ndeprive ourselves of the advantage springing from\ntile charm of novelty. Sometimes we shall even\nhave to hoodwink the judge and work upon him by\nvarious artifices so that he may think that our aim is\nother than what it really is. For there are cases\nwhen a proposition may be somewhat startling if the\njudge foresees this, he will shrink from it in advance,\nlike a patient who catches sight of the surgeon's\nknife before the operation. On the other hand, if\nwe have given him no preliminary notice and our\nwords take him unawares, without his interest in\nthem having been previously roused by any warning,\nwe shall gain a credence which we should not have\nsecured had we stated that we were going to raise\nthe point. At times we must not merely avoid\ndistinguishing between the various questions, but must\nomit them altogether, while our audience must be\ndistracted by appeals to the emotion and their attention diverted. For the duty of the orator is not merely to instruct the power of eloquence is greatest\nin emotional appeals. Now there is no room for\npassion if we devote our attention to minute and\nmicroscopic division at a time when we are seeking\nto mislead the judgment of the person who is trying\nthe case. Again, there are certain arguments which\nare weak and trivial when they stand alone, but\nwhich have great force when produced in a body.\nWe must, therefore, concentrate such arguments,\nand our tactics should be those of a sudden charge\nin mass. This, however, is a practice which should\nbe resorted to but rarely and only under extreme\nnecessity when reason compels us to take a course\nwhich is apparently irrational. In addition it must\nbe pointed out that in any partition there is always\nsome one point of such special importance, that when\nthe judge has heard it he is impatient with the remainder, which he regards as superfluous. Consequently if we have to prove or refute a number of\npoints partition will be both useful and attractive,\nsince it will indicate in order what we propose to say\non each subject. On the other hand, if we are defending one point on various grounds partition will\nbe unnecessary. If you were to make a partition such\nas the following, in that case all the proofs\nwhich you propose to bring before this, the final\nproof, must needs seem superfluous to the judge.\nFor the judge is always in a hurry to reach the most\nimportant point. If he has a patient disposition he\nwill merely make a silent appeal to the advocate, whom he will treat as bound by his promise. On\nthe other hand, if he is busy, or holds exalted\nposition, or is intolerant by nature, he will insist in\nno very courteous manner on his coming to the point.\nFor these reasons there are some who disapprove of\nthe partition adopted by Cicero in the pro Cluentio,\nwhere he premises that he is going to show, first, secondly, and\nfinally, They argue\nthat if the third point can be proved, there is no\nneed to have urged the two preceding. On the\nother hand you will find no one so unreasonable or so\nfoolish as to deny that the partition in the pro Murena\nis admirable. These words make the case as\nclear as possible, and no one division renders any\nother superfluous. There are also a number who are in doubt as to\na form of defence which I may exemplify as follows What, they ask, is the value of the\nfirst part, if the second can be proved, since they are\nmutually inconsistent, and if anyone employs both\narguments, we should believe neither This contention is partially justified; we should employ the second alone only if the fact can be proved without\na doubt. But if we have any doubts as to being able\nto prove the stronger argument, we shall do well to\nrely on both. Different arguments move different\npeople. He who thinks that the act was committed\nmay regard it as a just act, while he who is deaf to\nthe plea that the act was just may perhaps believe\nthat it was never committed one who is confident\nof his powers as a marksman may be content with one\nshaft, whereas he who has no such confidence will do\nwell to launch several and give fortune a chance to\ncome to his assistance. Cicero in the pro Milone\nreveals the utmost skill in showing first that Clodius\nlaid an ambush for Milo and then in adding as a\nsupernumerary argument that, even if he had not\ndone so, he was nevertheless so bad a citizen that\nhis slaying could only have done credit to the\npatriotism of the slayer and redounded to his glory.\nI would not however entirely condemn the order\nmentioned above, since there are certain arguments\nwhich, though hard in themselves, may serve to\nsoften those which come after. The proverb, is not wholly unreasonable. Still no one\nshould interpret it to mean that you must stop short\nof nothing. For the Greeks are right when they\nlay it down as a rule that we should not attempt\nthe impossible. But whenever the double-barrelled\ndefence of which I am speaking is employed, we\nmust aim at making the first argument support the\ncredibility of the second. For he who might without danger to himself have confessed to the commission of the act, can have no motive for lying\nwhen he denies the commission. Above all it is important, whenever we suspect\nthat the judge desires a proof other than that on\nwhich we are engaged, to promise that we will satisfy\nhim on the point fully and without delay, more\nespecially if the question is one of our client's\nhonour. But it will often happen that a discreditable case has the law on its side, and to prevent\nthe judges giving us only a grudging and reluctant hearing on the point of law, we shall have to\nwarn them with some frequency that we shall shortly\nproceed to defend our client's honour and integrity,\nif they will only wait a little and allow us to follow\nthe order of our proofs. We may also at times\npretend to say certain things against the wishes of\nour clients, as Cicero does in the pro Cluentio when\nhe discusses the law dealing with judicial corruption.\nOccasionally we may stop, as though interrupted by\nour clients, while often we shall address them and\nexhort them to let us act as we think best. Thus\nwe shall make a gradual impression on the mind of\nthe judge, and, buoyed up by the hope that we are\ngoing to clear our client's honour, he will be less ill-disposed toward the harder portions of our proof.\nAnd when he has accepted these, he will be all the\nreadier to listen to our defence of our client's\ncharacter. Thus the two points will render mutual\nassistance to each other; the judge will be more\nattentive to our legal proofs owing to his hope that\nwe shall proceed to a vindication of character and\nbetter disposed to accept that vindication because\nwe have proved our point of law. But although partition is neither always necessary\nnor useful, it will, if judiciously employed, greatly add to the lucidity and grace of our speech. For\nit not only makes our arguments clearer by isolating\nthe points from the crowd in which they would\notherwise be lost and placing them before the\neyes of the judge, but relieves his attention by\nassigning a definite limit to certain parts of our\nspeech, just as our fatigue upon a journey is relieved\nby reading the distances on the milestones which we\npass. For it is a pleasure to be able to measure how\nmuch of our task has been accomplished, and the\nknowledge of what remains to do stimulates us to\nfresh effort over the labour that still awaits us. For\nnothing need seem long, when it is definitely known\nhow far it is to the end. Quintus Hortensius\ndeserves the high praise which has been awarded\nhim for the care which he took over his partitions,\nalthough Cicero more than once indulges in kindly\nmockery of his habit of counting his headings on his\nfingers. For there is a limit to gesture, and we must\nbe specially careful to avoid excessive minuteness and\nany suggestion of articulated structure in our partition.\nIf our divisions are too small, they cease to be limbs\nand become fragments, and consequently detract not\na little from the authority of our speech. Moreover,\nthose who are ambitious of this sort of reputation,\nin order that they may appear to enhance the nicety\nand tile exhaustive nature of their division, introduce\nwhat is superfluous and subdivide things which\nnaturally form a single whole. The result of their\nlabours is, however, not so much to increase the\nnumber of their divisions as to diminish their importance, and after all is done and they have split\nup their argument into a thousand tiny compartments,\nthey fall into that very obscurity which the partition\nwas designed to eliminate. The proposition, whether single or multiple, must,\non every occasion when it can be employed with\nprofit, be clear and lucid; for what could be more\ndiscreditable than that a portion of the speech,\nwhose sole purpose is to prevent obscurity elsewhere, should itself be obscure Secondly it must\nbe brief and must not be burdened with a single\nsuperfluous word; for we are not explaining what\nwe are saying, but what we are going to say. We\nmust also ensure that it is free alike from omissions\nand from redundance. Redundance as a rule occurs\nthrough our dividing into species when it would be\nsufficient to divide into genera, or through the addition of species after stating the genus. The following\nwill serve as an example But justice and abstinence\nare species of tile genus virtue. Our first partition\nwill be between admitted and disputed facts.\nAdmitted facts will then be divided into those\nacknowledged by our opponent and those acknowledged by ourselves. Disputed facts will be divided\ninto those which we and those which our opponents\nallege. But the worst fault of all is to treat your\npoints in an order different from that which was\nassigned them in your proposition. There have been certain writers of no small\nauthority who have held that the sole duty of the\norator was to instruct in their view appeals to the\nemotions were to be excluded for two reasons, first\non the ground that all disturbance of the mind was\na fault, and secondly that it was wrong to distract\nthe judge from the truth by exciting his pity, bringing influence to bear, and the like. Further, to seek\nto charm the audience, when the aim of the orator\nwas merely to win success, was in their opinion not\nonly superfluous for a pleader, but hardly worthy of\na self-respecting man. The majority however, while\nadmitting that such arts undoubtedly formed part of\noratory, held that its special and peculiar task is to\nmake good the case which it maintains and refute\nthat of its opponent. Whichever of these views is\ncorrect for at this point I do not propose to express\nmy own opinion, they will regard this book as\nserving a very necessary purpose, since it will deal\nentirely with the points on which they lay such\nstress, although all that I have already said on the\nsubject of judicial causes is subservient to the same\nend. For the purpose of the exordium and the slatement of facts is merely to prepare the judge for these\npoints, while it would be a work of supererogation to\nknow the bases of cases or to consider the other points dealt with above, unless we intend to proceed\nto the consideration of the proof Finally, of the\nfive parts into which we divided judicial cases, any\nsingle one other than the proof may on occasion be\ndispensed with. But there can be no suit in which\nthe proof is not absolutely necessary. With regard\nto the rules to be observed in this connexion, we\nshall, I think, be wisest to follow our previous method\nof classification and show first what is common to all\ncases and then proceed to point out those which are\npeculiar to the several kinds of cases. Every artificial proof consists either of indications, arguments or examples. I am well aware that\nmany consider indications to form part of the arguments. My reasons for distinguishing them are twofold. In the first place indications as a rule come\nunder the head of inartificial proofs for a bloodstained garment, a shriek, a dark blotch and the like\nare all evidence analogous to documentary or oral\nevidence and rumours; they are not discovered by\nthe orator, but are given him with the case itself.\nMy second reason was that indications, if indubitable,\nare not arguments, since they leave no room for\nquestion, while arguments are only possible in\ncontroversial matters. If on the other hand they\nare doubtful, they are not arguments, but require\narguments to support them. The two first species into which artificial proofs may be divided are, as I have already said, those\nwhich involve a conclusion and those which do not.\nThe former are those which cannot be otherwise and\nare called by the Greeks, because they are\nindications from which there is no getting away.\nThese however seem to me scarcely to come under\nthe rules of art. For where an indication is irrefutable, there can be no dispute as to facts. This\nhappens whenever there can be no doubt that something is being or has been done, or when it is impossible for it to be or have been done. In such cases\nthere can be no dispute as to the fact. This kind of\nproof may be considered in connexion with past,\npresent or future time. For example, a woman who is\ndelivered of a child must have had intercourse with\na man, and the reference is to the past. When there\nis a high wind at sea, there must be waves, and the\nreference is to the present. When a man has received a wound in the heart, he is bound to die, and\nthe reference is to the future. Nor again can there\nbe a harvest where no seed has been sown, nor can\na man be at Rome when he is at Athens, nor have\nbeen wounded by a sword when he has no scar.\nSome have the same force when reversed a man\nwho breathes is alive, and a man who is alive breathes.\nSome again cannot be reversed because he who\nwalks moves it does not follow that he who moves\nwalks. So too a woman, who has not been delivered\nof a child, may have had intercourse with a man,\nthere may be waves without a high wind, and a man\nmay die without having received a wound in the\nheart. Similarly seed may be sown without a harvest\nresulting, a man, who was never at Athens, may never have been at Rome, and a man who has a scar\nmay not have received a sword-wound. There are other indications or that is\nprobabilities, as the Greeks call them, which do not\ninvolve a necessary conclusion. These may not\nbe sufficient in themselves to remove doubt, but\nmay yet be of the greatest value when taken in\nconjunction with other indications. The Latin\nequivalent of the Greek is signum, a sign,\nthough some have called it indicium, an indication,\nor vestigium, a trace. Such signs or indications\nenable us to infer that something else has happened;\nblood for instance may lead us to infer that a\nmurder has taken place. But bloodstains on a\ngarment may be the result of the slaying of a victim\nat a sacrifice or of bleeding at the nose. Everyone\nwho has a bloodstain on his clothes is not necessarily a murderer. But although such an indication\nmay not amount to proof in itself, yet it may be\nproduced as evidence in conjunction with other\nindications, such for instance as the fact that the\nman with the bloodstain was the enemy of the\nmurdered man, had threatened him previously or\nwas in the same place with him. Add the indication\nin question to these, and what was previously only a\nsuspicion may become a certainty. On the other\nhand there are indications which may be made to\nserve either party, such as livid spots, swellings\nwhich may be regarded as symptoms either of\npoisoning or of bad health, or a wound in the breast\nwhich may be treated as a proof of murder or of\nsuicide. The force of such indications depends on the\namount of extraneous support which they receive. Hermagoras would include among such indications as do not involve a necessary conclusion, an argument such as the following, If we accept this\nview, I fear that we shall come to treat all inferences\nfrom a fact as indications. None the less such arguments are in practice treated exactly as if they were\nindications. Nor do the Areopagites, when they\ncondemned a boy for plucking out the eyes of\nquails, seem to have had anything else in their\nmind than the consideration that such conduct\nwas an indication of a perverted character which\nmight prove hurtful to many, if he had been\nallowed to grow up. So, too, the popularity of\nSpurius Maelius and Marcus Manlius was regarded\nas an indication that they were aiming at supreme\npower. However, I fear that this line of reasoning\nwill carry us too far. For if it is an indication\nof adultery that a woman bathes with men, the\nfact that she revels with young men or even an\nintimate friendship will also be indications of the\nsame offence. Again depilation, a voluptuous gait,\nor womanish attire may be regarded as indications of\neffeminacy and unmanliness by anyone who thinks\nthat such symptoms are the result of an immoral\ncharacter, just as blood is the result of a wound for\nanything, that springs from the matter under investigation and comes to our notice, may properly\nbe called an indication. Similarly it is also usual\nto give the names of signs to frequently observed\nphenomena, such as prognostics of the weather which\nwe may illustrate by the Vergilian and If these phenomena are caused by the state of the\natmosphere, such an appellation is correct enough.\nFor if tile moon turns red owing to the wind, her\nhue is certainly a sign of wind. And if, as the same\npoet infers, the condensation and rarification of\nthe atmosphere causes that of which he speaks, we may agree in regarding it as\na sign. We may further note that great things are\nsometimes indicated by trivial signs, witness the\nVergilian crow; that trivial events should be\nindicated by signs of greater importance is of course\nno matter for wonder. I now turn to arguments, the name under\nwhich we comprise the and of the Greeks, terms which, in spite of\ntheir difference, have much the same meaning. For\nthe epicheireme which we translate by commentun or\ncommentatio, there being no alternative, though we\nshould be wiser to use the Greek name has three\nmeanings firstly it means anything conceived in\nthe mind this is not however the sense of which\nI am now speaking; secondly it signifies a proposition with a reason, and thirdly a conclusion of an\nargument drawn either from denial of consequents or\nfrom incompatibles; although there is some controversy on this point. For there are some who style a\nconclusion from consequents an epicheireme, while it\nwill be found that the majority hold the view that an\nepicheireme is a conclusion from incompatibles\nwherefore Cornificius styles it a contrarium or argument from contraries. Some again call it a rhetorical\nsyllogism, others an incomplete syllogism, because\nits parts are not so clearly defined or of the same\nnumber as those of the regular syllogism, since such precision is not specially required by the orator.\nValgius translates by aggressio, that is\nan attempt. It would however, in my opinion, be\ntruer to say that it is not our handling of the\nsubject, but the thing itself which we attempt which\nshould be called an that is to say the\nargument by which we try to prove something and\nwhich, even if it has not yet been stated in so many\nwords, has been clearly conceived by the mind.\nOthers regard it not as an attempted or imperfect\nproof, but a complete proof, falling under the most\nspecial species of proof; consequently, according to\nits proper and most generally received appellation it\nmust be understood in the sense of a definite conception of some thought consisting of at least three\nparts. Some call an a reason, but Cicero\nis more correct in calling it a reasoning, although he\ntoo seems to derive this name from the syllogism\nrather than anything else; for he calls the\nsyllogistic basis a ratiocinative basis and quotes philosophers to support him. And since there is a certain kinship between a syllogism and an epicheireme,\nit may be thought that he was justified in his use of\nthe latter term. An is a clear proof; hence\nthe use of the term by the geometricians. Caecilius\nholds that it differs from the epicheireme solely in the\nkind of conclusion arrived at and that an apodeixis is\nsimply an incomplete epicheireme for the same reason\nthat we said an enthymeme differed from a syllogism.\nFor an epicheireme is also part of a syllogism. Some\nthink that an apodeixis is portion of an epicheireme, namely the part containing the proof. But all\nauthorities, however much they may differ on other\npoints, define both in the same way, in so far as they\ncall both a method of proving what is not certain by\nmeans of what is certain. Indeed this is the nature\nof all arguments, for what is certain cannot be\nproved by what is uncertain. To all these forms of\nargument the Greeks give the name of , a\nterm which, though the literal translation is fides is best translated by probatio But argument has several other meanings.\nFor the plots of plays composed for acting in the\ntheatre are called arguments, while Pedianus, when\nexplaining the themes of the speeches of Cicero,\nsays The argument is as follows. Cicero himself in\nwriting to Brutus says, Fearing that I might transfer\nsomething from that source to my Cato, although the\nargument is quite different. It is thus clear that all\nsubjects for writing are so called. Nor is this to be\nwondered at, since the term is also in common use\namong artists; hence the Vergilian phrase A mighty\nargument. Again a work which deals with a number\nof different themes is called But the sense with which we are now concerned is\nthat which provides proof Celsus indeed treats\nthe terms, proof, indication, credibility, attempt,\nsimply as different names for the same things, in\nwhich, to my thinking, he betrays a certain confusion of thought. For proof and credibility are not\nmerely the result of logical processes, but may\nequally be secured by inartificial arguments. Now\nI have already distinguished signs or, as he prefers\nto call them, indications from arguments. Consequently, since an argument is a process of reasoning which provides proof and enables one thing to be\ninferred from another and confirms facts which are\nuncertain by reference to facts which are certain,\nthere must needs be something in every case which\nrequires no proof. Otherwise there will be nothing\nby which we can prove anything; there must be\nsomething which either is or is believed to be true,\nby means of which doubtful things may be rendered\ncredible. We may regard as certainties, first, those\nthings which we perceive by the senses, things for\ninstance that we hear or see, such as signs or indications; secondly, those things about which there is\ngeneral agreement, such as the existence of the gods\nor the duty of loving one's parents; thirdly, those\nthings which are established by law or have passed\ninto current usage, if not throughout the whole\nworld, at any rate in the nation or state where the\ncase is being pleadedthere are for instance many\nrights which rest not on law, but on custom; finally,\nthere are the things which are admitted by either\nparty, and whatever has already been proved or is\nnot disputed by our adversary. Thus for instance it\nmay be argued that since the world is governed by\nprovidence, the state should similarly be governed\nby some controlling power it follows that the state\nmust be so governed, once it is clear that the world\nis governed by providence. Further, the man who is\nto handle arguments correctly must know the nature\nand meaning of everything and their usual effects.\nFor it is thus that we arrive at probable arguments\nor as the Greeks call them. With regard to\ncredibility there are three degrees. First, the\nhighest, based on what usually happens, as for instance the assumption that children are loved by their parents. Secondly, there is the highly\nprobable, as for instance the assumption that a man\nin the enjoyment of good health will probably live\ntill to-morrow. The third degree is found where\nthere is nothing absolutely against an assumption,\nsuch as that a theft committed in a house was the\nwork of one of the household. Consequently\nAristotle in the second book of his Rhetoric has\nmade a careful examination of all that commonly\nhappens to things and persons, and what things and\npersons are naturally adverse or friendly to other\nthings or persons, as for instance, what is the\nnatural result of wealth or ambition or superstition,\nwhat meets with the approval of good men, what is\nthe object of a soldier's or a farmer's desires, and by\nwhat means everything is sought or shunned. For\nmy part I do not propose to pursue this subject. It\nis not merely a long, but an impossible or rather an\ninfinite task; moreover it is within the compass of\nthe common understanding of mankind. If, however, anyone wishes to pursue the subject, I have\nindicated where he may apply. But all credibility,\nand it is with credibility that the great majority of\narguments are concerned, turns on questions such\nas the following whether it is credible that a father\nhas been killed by his son, or that a father has committed incest with his daughter, or to take questions\nof an opposite character, whether it is credible that\na stepmother has poisoned her stepchild, or that a\nman of luxurious life has committed adultery; or\nagain whether a crime has been openly committed,\nor false evidence given for a small bribe, since each\nof these crimes is the result of a special cast of\ncharacter as a rule, though not always; if it were always so, there would be no room for doubt, and\nno argument. Let us now turn to consider the of arguments, although some hold that they are identical\nwith the topics which I have already discussed\nabove. But I do not use this term in its usual\nacceptance, namely, commonplaces directed against\nluxury, adultery, and the like, but in the sense of\nthe secret places where arguments reside, and from\nwhich they must be drawn forth. For just as all\nkinds of produce are not provided by every country,\nand as you will not succeed in finding a particular bird\nor beast, if you are ignorant of the localities where\nit has its usual haunts or birthplace, as even the\nvarious kinds of fish flourish in different surroundings, some preferring a smooth and others a rocky\nbottom, and are found on different shores and in\ndivers regions you will for instance never catch\na sturgeon or wrasse in Italian waters, so not\nevery kind of argument can be derived from every\ncircumstance, and consequently our search requires\ndiscrimination. Otherwise we shall fall into serious\nerror, and after wasting our labour through lack of\nmethod we shall fail to discover the argument which\nwe desire, unless assisted by some happy chance.\nBut if we know the circumstances which give rise to\neach kind of argument, we shall easily see, when\nwe come to a particular what arguments\nit contains. Firstly, then, arguments may be drawn from\npersons; for, as I have already said, all arguments\nfall into two classes, those concerned with things and\nthose concerned with persons, since causes, time,\nplace, occasion, instruments, means and the like are all accidents of things. I have no intention of\ntracing all the accidents of persons, as many have\ndone, but shall confine myself to those from which\narguments may be drawn. Such are birth, for\npersons are generally regarded as having some\nresemblance to their parents and ancestors, a resemblance which sometimes leads to their living\ndisgracefully or honourably, as the case may be;\nthen there is nationality, for races have their own\ncharacter, and the same action is not probable in the\ncase of a barbarian, a Roman and a Greek; country\nis another, for there is a like diversity in the laws,\ninstitutions and opinions of different states; sex,\nsince for example a man is more likely to commit a\nrobbery, a woman to poison; age, since different\nactions suit different ages; education and training,\nsince it makes a great difference who were the instructors and what the method of instruction in each\nindividual case; bodily constitution, for beauty is\noften introduced as an argument for lust, strength as\nan argument for insolence, and their opposites for\nopposite conduct; fortune, since the same acts are\nnot to be expected from rich and poor, or from one\nwho is surrounded by troops of relations, friends or\nclients and one who lacks all these advantages;\ncondition, too, is important, for it makes a great\ndifference whether a man be famous or obscure, a\nmagistrate or a private individual, a father or a son,\na citizen or a foreigner, a free man or a slave,\nmarried or unmarried, a father or childless. Nor\nmust we pass by natural disposition, for avarice,\nanger, pity, cruelty, severity and the like may often\nbe adduced to prove the credibility or the reverse of\na given act; it is for instance often asked whether a man's way of living be luxurious, frugal or parsimonious. Then there is occupation, since a rustic, a\nlawyer, a man of business, a soldier, a sailor, a doctor\nall perform very different actions. We must also\nconsider the personal ambitions of individuals, for\ninstance whether they wish to be thought rich or\neloquent, just or powerful. Past life and previous\nutterances are also a subject for investigation, since\nwe are in the habit of inferring the present from the\npast. To these some add passion, by which they\nmean some temporary emotion such as anger or fear;\nthey also add design, which may refer to the past,\npresent or future. These latter, however, although\naccidents of persons, should be referred to that class\nof arguments which we draw from causes, as also\nshould certain dispositions of mind, for example\nwhen we inquire whether one man is the friend or\nenemy of another. Names also are treated as\naccidents of persons; this is perfectly true, but names\nare rarely food for argument, unless indeed they\nhave been given for some special reasons, such as the\ntitles of Wise, Great, Pious, or unless the name has\nsuggested some special thought to the bearer.\nLentulus for instance had the idea of conspiracy\nsuggested to him by the fact that according to the\nSibylline books and the Responses of the soothsayers the tyranny was promised to three members\nof the Cornelian family, and he considered himself to\nbe the third in succession to Sulla and Cinna, since\nhe too bore the name Cornelius. On tile other hand\nthe conceit employed by Euripides where he makes\nEteocles taunt his brother Polynices on the ground\nthat his name is evidence of character, is feeble in\nthe extreme. Still a name will often provide the\nsubject for a jest, witness the frequent jests of Cicero on the name of Verres. Such, then, and the\nlike are the accidents of persons. It is impossible\nto deal with them all either here or in other portions\nof this work, and I must content myself with pointing out the lines on which further enquiry should\nproceed. I now pass to things of these actions are the most\nnearly connected with persons and must therefore be\ntreated first. In regard to every action the question\narises either Why or Where or When or How or By\nwhat means the action is performed. Consequently\narguments are drawn from the causes of past or future\nactions. The matter of these causes, by some called by others falls into two genera, which\nare each divided into four species. For the motive\nfor any action is as a rule concerned with the acquisition, increase, preservation and use of things that are\ngood or with the avoidance, diminution, endurance\nof things that are evil or with escape there from.\nAll these considerations carry great weight in deliberative oratory as well. But right actions have\nright motives, while evil actions are the result of\nfalse opinions, which originate in the things which\nmen believe to be good or evil. Hence spring errors\nand evil passions such as anger, hatred, envy, desire,\nhope, ambition, audacity, fear and others of a similar\nkind. To these accidental circumstances may often\nbe added, such as drunkenness or ignorance, which\nserve sometimes to excuse and sometimes to prove\na charge, as for instance when a man is said to have\nkilled one person while lying in wait for another.\nFurther, motives are often discussed not merely to\nconvict the accused of the offence with which he is\ncharged, but also to defend him when he contends that his action was right, that is to say proceeded\nfrom an honourable motive, a theme of which I have\nspoken more fully in the third book. Questions\nof definition are also at times intimately connected\nwith motives. Is a man a tyrannicide if he kills a\ntyrant by whom he has been detected in the act\nof adultery Or is lie guilty of sacrilege who tore\ndown arms dedicated in a temple to enable him to\ndrive the enemy from the city Arguments are also\ndrawn from place. With a view to proving our facts\nwe consider such questions as whether a place is hilly\nor level, near the coast or inland, planted or uncultivated, crowded or deserted, near or far, suitable for\ncarrying out a given design or the reverse. This is a\ntopic which is treated most carefully by Cicero in his\npro Milone. These points and the like generally\nrefer to questions of fact, but occasionally to\nquestions of law as well. For we may ask whether\na place is public or private, sacred or profane, our\nown or another's, just as where persons are concerned\nwe ask whether a man is a magistrate, a father, a\nforeigner. Hence arise such questions as the following. You have committed an assault, but since the\nobject of your assault was a magistrate, the crime is\nlse-majest. Similarly it may be urged in defence, But such points afford matter for\nargument when there is a controversy as to the\nfacts, and matter for enquiry when the dispute\nturns on a point of law. Place also frequently affects the quality of an action, for the same action\nis not always lawful or seemly under all circumstances, while it makes considerable difference in\nwhat state the enquiry is taking place, for they differ\nboth in custom and law. Further arguments drawn\nfrom place may serve to secure approval or the\nreverse. Ajax for instance in Ovid says Again one of the many charges brought against\nMilo was that he killed Clodius on the monument of\nhis ancestors. Such arguments may also carry\nweight in deliberative oratory, as may those drawn\nfrom time, which I shall now proceed to discuss.\nTime may, as I have said elsewhere, be understood\nin two different senses, general and special. The first\nsense is seen in words and phrases such as and whenever we speak\nof past, present or future. The second sense occurs\nwhen we speak either of definite periods of time\nsuch as or of fortuitous periods such as Certain Latin writers have thought it a sufficient\ndistinction to call the general sense and the\nspecial In both senses time is of importance\nin advisory speeches and demonstrative oratory, but\nnot so frequently as in forensic. For questions of law\nturn on time, while it also determines the quality of\nactions and is of great importance in questions of\nfact; for instance, occasionally it provides irrefragable proofs, which may be illustrated by a case which I\nhave already cited, when one of the signatories to a\ndocument has died before the day on which it was\nsigned, or when a person is accused of the commission of some crime, although he was only an infant\nat the time or not yet born. Further, all kinds of\narguments may easily be drawn either from facts\nprevious to a certain act, or contemporary or subsequent. As regards antecedent facts the following\nexample will illustrate my meaning; Motives of actions may also belong to\npast time. Some writers have shown themselves\nover-subtle in their classification of the second class\nof circumstances, making an\nexample of circumstances combined with an act and an instance of circumstances\nattached to an act. As regards subsequent circumstances I may cite accusations such as The counsel for the defence will\nemploy the same divisions of time to discredit the\ncharge which is brought against him. In these\nconsiderations are included everything in connexion\nwith words and deeds, but in two distinct ways.\nFor some things are done because something else is\nlike to follow, and others because something else\nhas previously been done, as for instance, when the\nhusband of a beautiful woman is accused of having\nacted as a procurer on the ground that he bought\nher after she was found guilty of adultery, or\nwhen a debauched character is accused of parricide on the ground that he said to his father For in the former case the accused is not a procurer\nbecause he bought the woman, but bought her\nbecause he was a procurer, while in the latter the\naccused is not a parricide because he used these\nwords, but used them because lie intended to kill his\nfather. With regard to accidental circumstances,\nwhich also provide matter for arguments, these\nclearly belong to subsequent time, but are distinguished by a certain special quality, as for instance if\nI should say, ;; ;\nor referring to bad qualities, ; We must also\nconsider the resources possessed by the parties\nconcerned, more especially when dealing with questions of fact; for it is more credible that a smaller\nnumber of persons were killed by a larger, a weaker\nparty by a stronger, sleepers by men that were wide\nawake, the unsuspecting by the well-prepared, while\nthe converse arguments may be used to prove the\nopposite. Such considerations arise both in deliberative and forensic oratory in the latter they occur\nin relation to two questions, namely, whether some\ngiven person had the will, and whether lie had the\npower to do the deed; for hope will often create\nthe will to act. Hence the well-known inference in\nCicero With resources we may couple instruments, which form part of resources and\nmeans. But sometimes instruments will provide us\nwith indications as well, as for instance if we find\na javelin sticking in a dead body. To these we may\nadd manner, the Greek in regard to which\nwe ask how a thing was done. Manner is concerned\nsometimes with quality and the letter of the law\nwe may for instance argue that it was unlawful to\nkill an adulterer by poison, sometimes with questions of fact, as for example if I argue that an act\nwas committed with a good intent and therefore\nopenly, or with a bad intent and therefore treacherously, by night, in a lonely place. In all cases, however, in which we enquire into the\nnature and meaning of an act, and which can be\nconsidered by themselves apart from all considerations of persons and all else that gives rise to the\nactual cause, there are clearly three points to which\nwe must give attention, namely Whether it is, What\nit is and Of what kind it is. But as there are certain of argument which are common to\nall three questions, this triple division is impracticable and we must therefore consider these questions rather in connexion with those in\nwhich they most naturally arise. Arguments, then,\nmay be drawn from definition, sometimes called\nfinitio and sometimes finis. Definition is of two\nkinds. We may ask whether a particular quality is a\nvirtue or make a definition precede and ask what is\nthe nature of a virtue. Such a definition is either\nstated in general terms, such as Rhetoric is the science\nof speaking well, or in detail, such as Rhetoric is the\nscience of correct conception, arrangement and utterance,\ncoupled with a retentive memory and a dignified delivery. Further, we may define a word by giving its content\nas in the preceding instances, or by etymology we\nmay for instance explain assiduus by deriving it from\nas and do, locuples by deriving it from copia locorum,\npecuniosus from copiapecorum. Genus, species, difference\nand property seem more especially to afford scope for\ndefinition, for we derive arguments from all of these.\nGenus is of little use when we desire to prove a\nspecies, but of great value for its elimination. A tree\nis not necessarily a plane tree, but that which is not\na tree is certainly not a plane tree; again, a virtue is\nnot necessarily the virtue of justice, but that which\nis not a virtue is certainly not justice. We must\nproceed from the genus to the ultimate species; for\nexample, to say that man is an animal will not\nsuffice; for animal merely gives us the genus nor\nyet will the addition of the words be adequate; for although this epithet gives\nus a species, it is common to other animals as well.\nIf, however, we define man as a rational animal, we\nneed nothing further to make our meaning clear.\nOn the other hand species will give us clear proof of\ngenus, but is of little service for its elimination.\nFor example, justice is always a virtue, but that\nwhich is not justice may still be a virtue, such as\nfortitude, constancy or self-control. Genus therefore\ncannot be eliminated by species unless all the species\nincluded in the genus be eliminated, as for instance\nin the following sentence That which is neither rational nor mortal nor an animal is not a man. To these they\nadd property and difference. Properties serve to\nestablish definitions, differences to overthrow them.\nA property is that which happens to one particular\nobject and that alone; speech and laughter for\ninstance are properties of man. Or it may be something specially belonging to an object, but not to it\nalone; heating for instance is a property of fire. The\nsame thing may also have a number of properties\nlight and heat are both properties of fire. Consequently, the omission of any property in a definition\nwill impair it, but the introduction of a property,\nwhatever it may be, will not necessarily establish a\ndefinition. We have, however, often to consider\nwhat is a property of some given object; for example,\nif it should be asserted, on the ground of etymology,\nthat the peculiar property of a tyrannicide is to kill\ntyrants, we should deny it for an executioner is not\nipso facto a tyrannicide, if he executes a tyrant who\nhas been delivered to him for the purpose, nor again\nis he a tyrannicide who kills a tyrant unwittingly or\nagainst his will. What is not a property will be a\ndifference it is, for instance, one thing to be a slave,\nand another to be in a state of servitude; hence the\ndistinction raised in connexion with persons assigned\nto their creditors for debt A slave, if he is manumitted becomes a freedman, but this is not the case with\none who is assigned. There are also other points of\ndifference which are dealt with elsewhere. Again,\nthe term difference is applied in cases when the\ngenus is divided into species and one species is subdivided. Animal, for instance, is a genus, mortal a\nspecies, while terrestrial or biped is a difference for\nthey are not actually properties, but serve to show the difference between such animals and quadrupeds\nor creatures of the sea. This distinction, however,\ncomes under the province not so much of argument\nas of exact definition. Cicero separates genus and species, which latter he calls form, from definition\nand includes them under relation. For example,\nif a person to whom another man has left all his\nsilver should claim all his silver money as well, he\nwould base his claim upon genus; on the other hand\nif when a legacy has been left to a married woman\nholding the position of materfamilias, it should be\nmaintained that the legacy is not due to a woman\nwho never came into the power of her husband, the\nargument is based on species, since there are two\nkinds of marriage. Cicero further shows that\ndefinition is assisted by division, which he distinguishes from partition, making the latter the\ndissection of a whole into its parts and the former\nthe division of a genus into its forms or species. The\nnumber of parts he regards as being uncertain, as for\ninstance the elements of which a state consists; the\nforms or species are, however, certain, as for instance\nthe number of forms of government, which we are\ntold are three, democracy, oligarchy, and monarchy.\nIt is true that he does not use these illustrations,\nsince, as he was writing to Trebatius, he preferred\nto draw his examples from law. I have chosen my\nillustrations as being more obvious. Properties have\nrelation to questions of fact as well; for instance,\nit is the property of a good man to act rightly, of an\nangry man to be violent in speech or action, and\nconsequently we believe that such acts are committed by persons of the appropriate character, or not committed by persons of inappropriate character.\nFor just as certain persons possess certain qualities,\nso certain others do not possess certain qualities,\nand the argument is of precisely the same nature,\nthough from opposite premises. In a similar way division is valuable both for proof\nand refutation. For proof, it is sometimes enough to\nestablish one thing. For refutation,\nboth points must be disproved This may be done in many ways,\nand constitutes a form of argument by elimination,\nwhereby we show sometimes that the whole is false,\nsometimes that only that which remains alter the\nprocess of elimination is true. An example of the\nfirst of these two cases would be The residue after elimination is shown to be true as follows By the elimination\nof the previous suppositions he is shown to belong to\nanother. This form of argument is risky and must\nbe employed with care; for if, in setting forth the\nalternatives, we chance to omit one, our whole case\nwill fail, and our audience will be moved to laughter.\nIt is safer to do what Cicero does in the pro\nCaecina, when he asks, For thus all other points are eliminated at\none swoop. Or again two contrary propositions may be\nadvanced, either of which if established would suffice to prove the case. Take the following example\nfrom Cicero Or\nwe may give our opponent the choice between two\nalternatives of which one must necessarily be true,\nand as a result, whichever he chooses, lie will\ndamage his case. Cicero does this in the pro\nOppio and in the pro Vareno He then shows\nthat either admission tells against his opponent.\nSometimes again, two propositions are stated of such\na character that the admission of either involves\nthe same conclusion, as in the sentence, or as in\nthe common dilemma, or, As there are three divisions of time, so the order\nof events falls into three stages. For everything has a\nbeginning, growth and consummation, as for instance a quarrel, blows, murder. Thus arise arguments which\nlend each other mutual support; for the conclusion\nis inferred from the beginnings, as in the following\ncase ; or the\nbeginning may be inferred from the conclusion\nfor instance the fact that Sulla resigned the dictatorship is an argument that Sulla did not take up\narms with the intention of establishing a tyranny.\nSimilarly from the growth of a situation we may\ninfer either its beginning or its end, not only in\nquestions of fact but as regards points of equity,\nsuch as whether the conclusion is referable to the\nbeginning, that is, Arguments are also drawn from similarities To this class belongs\nthe type of argument called by the Greeks,\ninduction by Cicero. Or arguments may be drawn\nfrom unlikes  Or\nfrom contraries   Or\nfrom contradictions Or from consequences necessary or probable  And such arguments\nmay also be reversed. Similar to these are the\nfollowing arguments, which must therefore be\nclassed under this same head, since it is to this\nthat they naturally belong   However, such arguments, being incontrovertible,\nare of the nature of absolute indications. These,\nhowever, I call consequent or goodness, for\ninstance, is consequent on wisdom while in regard\nto things which merely have taken place afterwards or\nwill take place I use the term insequent or though I do not regard the question of terminology\nas important. Give them any name you please, as\nlong as the meaning is clear and it is shown that\nthe one depends on time, the other on the\nnature of things. I have therefore no hesitation in\ncalling the following forms of argument also consequential, although they argue from the past to the\nfuture some however divide them into two classes,\nthose concerned with action, as in the pro Oppio, and those concerned with time, as in\nthe Verrines, Both these instances are of such a nature that the argument is\nreversible. For it is a necessary consequence that\nthose who could not be taken to the province\nagainst their will could not be retained against their\nwill. So too I feel clear that we should rank as\nconsequential arguments those derived from facts\nwhich lend each other mutual support and are by\nsome regarded as forming a separate kind of argument, which they call arguments\nfrom things mutually related, while Cicero styles\nthem arguments drawn from things to which the\nsame line of reasoning applies; take the following\nexample or Such also is the fine sentence of Domitius Afer,\nwhich has the same effect, though it is not identical\nin form Arguments which prove the same thing from opposites\nare also mutually consequential; for instance, we may\nargue that he who says that the world was created\nthereby implies that it is suffering decay, since this\nis the property of all created things. There is another very similar form of argument,\nwhich consists in the inference of facts from their\nefficient causes or the reverse, a process known as\nargument from causes. The conclusion is sometimes\nnecessary, sometimes generally without being necessarily true. For instance, a body casts a shadow in\nthe light, and the shadow wherever it falls indicates\nthe presence of a body. There are other conclusions\nwhich, as I have said, are not necessary, whether as\nregards both cause and effect or only one of the two.\nFor instance, As examples\nof necessary conclusions on the other hand I may\ncite the following ; and again, or In these\ncases the conclusion is correct. On the other hand, Arguments such as the following belong in the main to\nthe hortative department of oratory But the warning that we\nshould not necessarily search for the originating\ncause is just an example of such error is provided\nby the speech of Medea beginning as though her misery or guilt were due to the fact\nthat there or I might cite the words addressed by Philoctetes\nto Paris, By tracing back causes on lines such as these we\nmay arrive anywhere. But for the fact that Cicero\nhas done so, I should regard it as absurd to add to\nthese what is styled the conjugate argument, such as a self-evident fact requiring no proof; or again, Some call these arguments\nderived from causes or efficients by the Greek name that is, results; for in such cases the only\npoint considered is how one thing results from\nanother. Those arguments which prove the lesser from the\ngreater or the greater from the less or equals from\nequals are styled apposite or comparative. A conjecture as to a fact is confirmed by argument from\nsomething greater in the following sentence ;\nfrom something less, in a sentence such as ; from\nsomething equal in a sentence such as Points of law may be\nproved in a similar manner; from something greater,\nas in the sentence ; from something less, ; from\nsomething equal, In all these cases we follow the syllogistic\nmethod. The following type of argument on the\nother hand is more serviceable in questions turning on definition or quality. I am\ncontent to treat this type of argument as a genus\nwithout going further; others however divide it into\nspecies. For we may argue from several things to\none or from one thing to several; hence arguments\nsuch as We may also argue from a part to a whole,\nfrom genus to species, from that which contains to\nthat which is contained, from the difficult to the\neasy, from the remote to the near, and similarly\nfrom the opposites of all these to their opposites.\nNow all these arguments deal with the greater or\nthe less or else with things that are equal, and if we\nfollow up such fine distinctions, there will be no\nlimit to our division into species. For the comparison of things is infinite; things may be more\npleasant, more serious, more necessary, more honourable, more useful. I say no more for fear of falling\ninto that very garrulity which I deprecate. The\nnumber of examples of these arguments which I\nmight quote is likewise infinite, but I will only deal\nwith a very few. As an example of argument from\nsomething greater take the following example from\nthe pro Caecina As an instance of\nargument from something easier, take this passage from the speech against Clodius and Curio The following provides an example of argument from\nsomething more difficult ; and again, For an argument drawn from\nsomething less take this passage from the pro\nCaecinaa Well, then, to give a brief\nsummary of the whole question, arguments are\ndrawn from persons, causes, place and time which\nlatter we have divided into preceding, contemporary\nand subsequent, from resources under which we\ninclude instruments, from manner that is, how a\nthing has been done, from definition, genus, species,\ndifference, property, elimination, division, beginnings, increase, consummation, likes, unlikes, contradictions, consequents, efficients, effects, results,\nand comparison, which is subdivided into several\nspecies. I think I should also add that arguments are\ndrawn not merely from admitted facts, but from\nfictitious suppositions, which the Greeks style and that this latter type of argument falls\ninto all the same divisions as those which I have mentioned above, since there may be as many\nspecies of fictitious arguments as there are of true\narguments. When I speak of fictitious arguments\nI mean the proposition of something which, if true,\nwould either solve a problem or contribute to its\nsolution, and secondly the demonstration of the\nsimilarity of our hypothesis to the case under consideration. To make this the more readily intelligible to youths who have not yet left school, I will\nfirst of all illustrate it by examples of a kind familiar\nto the young. There is a law to the effect that A certain man fails to support his\nparents and none the less objects to going to prison.\nHe advances the hypothesis that he would be exempt\nfrom such a penalty if he were a soldier, an infant.\nor if he were absent from home on the service of\nthe state. Again in the case where a hero is allowed\nto choose his reward we might introduce the\nhypotheses of his desiring to make himself a tyrant\nor to overthrow the temples of the gods. Such\narguments are specially useful when we are arguing\nagainst the letter of the law, and are thus employed\nby Cicero in the pro Caecina Many other examples\nmight be quoted from the same work. But fictitious\nsuppositions are also exceedingly useful when we\nare concerned with the quality of an act It is useful\nalso for amplification ;\nor again, Such in the main are the usual topics of proof\nas specified by teachers of rhetoric, but it is not\nsufficient to classify them generically in our instructions, since from each of them there arises an infinite\nnumber of arguments, while it is in the very nature\nof things impossible to deal with all their individual\nspecies. Those who have attempted to perform\nthis latter task have exposed themselves in equal\ndegree to two disadvantages, saying too much and\nyet failing to cover the whole ground. Consequently\nthe majority of students, finding themselves lost in\nan inextricable maze, have abandoned all individual\neffort, including even that which their own wits\nmight have placed within their power, as though\nthey were fettered by certain rigid laws, and keeping their eyes fixed upon their master have ceased\nto follow the guidance of nature. But as it is not\nin itself sufficient to know that all proofs are drawn\neither from persons or things, because each of these\ngroups is subdivided into a number of different heads\nso he who has learned that arguments must be\ndrawn from antecedent, contemporary or subsequent facts will not be sufficiently instructed in\nthe knowledge of the method of handling arguments\nto understand what arguments are to be drawn from\nthe circumstances of each particular case; especially\nas the majority of proofs are to be found in the\nspecial circumstances of individual cases and have no connexion with any other dispute, and therefore\nwhile they are the strongest, are also the least\nobvious, since, whereas we derive what is common\nto all cases from general rules, we have to discover\nfor ourselves whatever is peculiar to the case which\nwe have in hand. This type of argument may\nreasonably be described as drawn from circumstances, there being no other word to express the\nGreek or from those things which are\npeculiar to any given case. For instance, in the\ncase of the priest who having committed adultery\ndesired to save his own life by means of the law\nwhich gave him the power of saving one life, the\nappropriate argument to employ against him would\nrun as follows For\nsuch an argument follows from the law forbidding\nthe execution of the adulteress apart from the\nadulterer. Again, take the case falling under the\nlaw which lays down that bankers may pay only\nhalf of what they owe, while permitted to recover\nthe whole of what they are owed. One banker\nrequires payment of the whole sum owed him by\nanother banker. The appropriate argument supplied\nby the subject to the creditor is that there was\nspecial reason for the insertion of the clause\nsanctioning the recovery of the whole of a debt\nby a banker, since there was no need of such a law\nas against others, inasmuch as all have the right to\nrecover the whole of a debt from any save a banker.\nBut while some fresh considerations are bound to\npresent themselves in every kind of subject, this is\nmore especially the case in questions turning on the letter of the law, since not merely individual\nwords, but still more whole phrases are frequently\nambiguous. And these considerations must vary\naccording to the complexity of laws and other\ndocuments, whether they are in agreement or contradictory, since fact throws light on fact and law on\nlaw as in the following argument It is laid down by law that he\nwho refuses to defend his father when accused of\ntreason thereby loses his right to inherit. A son\ndenies that he is liable to this penalty unless his\nfather is acquitted. How does he support this contention There is another law to the effect that a\nman found guilty of treason shall be banished and\nhis advocate with him. Cicero in the pro Cluentio\nsays that Publius Popilius and Tiberius Gutta were\nnot condemned for receiving bribes to give a false\nverdict, but for attempting to bribe the jury. What\nis his argument in support of this view That\ntheir accusers, who were themselves found guilty of\nbribing the jury, were restored in accordance with\nlaw after winning their case. But the consideration\nas to what argument should be put forward requires\nno less care than the consideration of the manner in\nwhich we are to prove that which we have put\nforward. Indeed in this connexion invention, if\nnot the most important, is certainly the first consideration. For, just as weapons are superfluous\nfor one who does not know what his target is, so\ntoo arguments are useless, unless you see in advance\nto what they are to be applied. This is a task for\nwhich no formal rules can be laid down. Consequently, though a number of orators, who have\nstudied the same rules, will use similar kinds of\narguments, one will discover a greater number of\narguments to suit his case than another. Let us\ntake as an example a controversial theme involving\nproblems that have little in common with other\ncases. The\ncase is tried before the Amphictyonic council. It is\nadmitted that the Thebans lent the money and\nwere not repaid. The whole dispute turns on the\nallegation that Alexander had excused the Thessalians from payment of the debt. It is also admitted\nthat the Thessalians had received no money from\nAlexander. The question is therefore whether his\ngift is equivalent to his having given them money.\nWhat use will formal topics of argument be in such\na case, unless I first convince myself that the gift of\nAlexander made no difference, that he had not the\npower to make it, and that he did not make it\nThe opening of the Thebans' plea presents no\ndifficulty and is likely to win the approval of the\njudges, since they are seeking to recover by right\nwhat was taken from them by force. But out of this\npoint arises a violent controversy as to the right of\nwar, since the Thessalians urge that kingdoms and\npeoples and the frontiers of nations and cities\ndepend upon these rights. To meet this argument it is necessary to discover in what respect this case\ndiffers from others which are concerned with property that has fallen into the hands of the victor\nthe difficulty moreover lies not so much in the\nproof as in the way it should be put forward. We\nmay begin by stating that the rights of war do not\nhold good in any matter which can be brought\nbefore a court of justice, and that what is taken\nby force of arms can only be retained by force of\narms, and consequently, wherever the rights of war\nhold good, there is no room for the functions of\na judge, while on the contrary where the functions\nof the judge come into play, the rights of war cease\nto have any force. The reason why it is necessary\nto discover this principle is to enable us to bring\nthe following argument into play that prisoners of\nwar are free on returning to their native land just\nbecause the gains of war cannot be retained except\nby the exercise of the same violence by which they\nwere acquired. Another peculiar feature of the case\nis that it is tried before the Amphictyonic council,\nand you will remember that we have to employ\ndifferent methods in pleading a case before the\ncentumviral court and before an arbitrator, though\nthe problems of the cases may be identical. Secondly\nwe may urge that the right to refuse payment could\nnot have been conferred by the victor because he\npossesses only what he holds, but a right, being\nincorporeal, cannot be grasped by the hand. It is\nmore difficult to discover this principle than, once\ndiscovered, to defend it with arguments such as\nthat the position of an heir and a conqueror are\nfundamentally different, since right passes to the\none and property to the other. It is further an argument peculiar to the subject matter of the case\nthat the right over a public debt could not have\npassed to the victor, because the repayment of a\nsum of money lent by a whole people is due to them\nall, and as long as any single one of them survives,\nhe is creditor for the whole amount but the\nThebans were never all of them to a man in Alexander's power. The force of this argument resides\nin the fact that it is not based on any external\nsupport, but holds good in itself. Proceeding to\nthe third line of argument we may note that the\nfirst portion of it is of a more ordinary type, namely\nthat the right to repayment is not based on the\nactual document, a plea which can be supported\nby many arguments. Doubt may also be thrown on\nAlexander's purpose did he intend to honour them\nor to trick them Another argument peculiar to\nthe subject indeed it practically introduces a new\ndiscussion is that the Thebans may be regarded as\nhaving in virtue of their restoration recovered the\nright even though it be admitted that they had lost\nit. Again Cassander's purpose may be discussed,\nbut, as the case is being pleaded before the Amphictyonic council, we shall find that the most powerful\nplea that can be urged is that of equity. I make these remarks, not because I think that a\nknowledge of the from which arguments\nmay be derived is useless had I thought so, I\nshould have passed them bybut to prevent those\nwho have learnt these rules from neglecting\nother considerations and regarding themselves as\nhaving a perfect and absolute knowledge of the\nwhole subject, and to make them realise that,\nunless they acquire a thorough knowledge of the remaining points which I am about to discuss, they\nwill be the possessors of what I can only call a dumb\nscience. For the discovery of arguments was not\nthe result of the publication of text-books, but every\nkind of argument was put forward before any rules\nwere laid down, and it was only later that writers\nof rhetoric noted them and collected them for publication. A proof of this is the fact that the examples which they use are old and quoted from the\norators, while they themselves discover nothing new\nor that has not been said before. The creators of\nthe art were therefore the orators, though we owe\na debt of gratitude also to those who have given us\na short cut to knowledge. For thanks to them the\narguments discovered by the genius of earlier orators\nhave not got to be hunted out and noted down in\ndetail. But this does not suffice to make an orator\nany more than it suffices to learn the art of gymnastic\nin school the body must be assisted by continual\npractice, self control, diet and above all by nature;\non the other hand none of these are sufficient in\nthemselves without the aid of art. I would also\nhave students of oratory consider that all the forms\nof argument which I have just set forth cannot be\nfound in every case, and that when the subject on\nwhich we have to speak has been propounded, it is\nno use considering each separate type of argument\nand knocking at the door of each with a view to\ndiscovering whether they may chance to serve to\nprove our point, except while we are in the position\nof mere learners without any knowledge of actual\npractice. Such a proceeding merely retards the\nprocess of speaking to an incalculable extent, if\nit is always necessary for us to try each single argument and thus learn by experiment what is apt\nand suitable to our case. In fact I am not sure that\nit will not be an actual obstacle to progress unless\na certain innate penetration and a power of rapid\ndivination seconded by study lead us straight to the\narguments which suit our case. For just as the\nmelody of the voice is most pleasing when accompanied by the lyre, yet if the musician's hand be\nslow and, unless he first look at the strings and\ntake their measure, hesitate as to which strings\nmatch the several notes of the voice, it would\nbe better that he should content himself with the\nnatural music of the voice unaccompanied by any\ninstrument; even so our theory of speaking must be\nadapted and, like the lyre, attuned to such rules as\nthese. But it is only by constant practice that we\ncan secure that, just as the hands of the musician,\neven though his eyes be turned elsewhere, produce\nbass, treble or intermediate notes by force of habit,\nso the thought of the orator should suffer no delay\nowing to the variety and number of possible arguments, but that the latter should present themselves\nuncalled and, just as letters and syllables require no\nthought on the part of a writer, so arguments should\nspontaneously follow the thought of the orator. The third kind of proof, which is drawn into\nthe service of the case from without, is styled a by the Greeks, who apply the term to all\ncomparisons of like with like, but more especially\nto historical parallels. Roman writers have for the\nmost part preferred to give the name of comparison\nto that which the Greeks style while they\ntranslate by example, although this\nlatter involves comparison, while the former is of the nature of an example. For my own part, I\nprefer with a view to making my purpose easier of\napprehension to regard both as and to\ncall them examples. Nor am I afraid of being\nthought to disagree with Cicero, although he does\nseparate comparison from example. For he divides\nall arguments into two classes, induction and\nratiocination, just as most Greeks divide it into and explaining as a rhetorical induction. The method of argument\nchiefly used by Socrates was of this nature when\nhe had asked a number of questions to which his\nadversary could only agree, he finally inferred the\nconclusion of the problem under discussion from its\nresemblance to the points already conceded. This\nmethod is known as induction, and though it\ncannot be used in a set speech, it is usual in a\nspeech to assume that which takes the form of a\nquestion in dialogue. For instance take the following question This will be admitted. Several more questions\nof the same kind follow. Last comes the question\nfor the sake of which all the others were put The answer can only be in the affirmative.\nSuch a procedure is most valuable in the examination of witnesses, but is differently employed in a set\nspeech. For there the orator either answers his\nown questions or makes an assumption of that which\nin dialogue takes the form of a question. All arguments of this kind, therefore, must be\nfrom things like or unlike or contrary. Similes are,\nit is true, sometimes employed for the embellishment of the speech as well, but I will deal with\nthem in their proper place; at present I am concerned with the use of similitude in proof. The most\nimportant of proofs of this class is that which is most\nproperly styled example, that is to say the adducing\nof some past action real or assumed which may\nserve to persuade the audience of the truth of the\npoint which we are trying to make. We must\ntherefore consider whether the parallel is complete\nor only partial, that we may know whether to use it\nin its entirety or merely to select those portions\nwhich are serviceable. We argue from the like\nwhen we say, ; from the unlike when we say,\n; from the contrary when we say, The same divisions apply also to\nsuch forms of proof in panegyric or denunciation.\nIt will also be found useful when we are speaking of\nwhat is likely to happen to refer to historical parallels\nfor instance if the orator asserts that Dionysius is\nasking for a bodyguard that with their armed assistance he may establish himself as tyrant, he may adduce the parallel case of Pisistratus who secured\nthe supreme power by similar means. But while examples may at times, as in the last\ninstance, apply in their entirety, at times we shall\nargue from the greater to the less or from the less\nto the greater. Arguments from unlikes are most useful in exhortation. Courage is more remarkable in a woman\nthan in a man. Therefore, if we wish to kindle\nsomeone's ambition to the performance of heroic\ndeeds, we shall find that parallels drawn from\nthe cases of Horatius and Torquatus will carry\nless weight than that of the woman by whose\nhand Pyrrhus was slain, and if we wish to urge\na man to meet death, the cases of Cato and\nScipio will carry less weight than that of\nLucretia. These are however arguments from the\ngreater to the less. Let me then give you separate\nexamples of these classes of argument from the\npages of Cicero; for where should I find better\nThe following passage from the pro Murena is an\ninstance of argument from the like The pro Milone will give us an\nexample of argument from the greater to the less The following is an\nexample of argument from the less to the greater and so\non till we come to, ;\nthen follows the whole invective against Clodius. Arguments from unlikes present great variety, for\nthey may turn on kind, manner, time, place, etcetera,\nalmost every one of which Cicero employs to overthrow the previous decisions that seemed to apply\nto the case of Cluentius, while he makes use of\nargument from contraries when lie minimises the\nimportance of the censorial stigma by praising Scipio\nAfricanus, who in his capacity of censor allowed one\nwhom he openly asserted to have committed deliberate perjury to retain his horse, because no one\nhad appeared as evidence against him, though he promised to come forward himself to bear witness to\nhis guilt, if any should be found to accuse him. I\nhave paraphrased this passage because it is too long\nto quote. A brief example of a similar argument is\nto be found in Virgil, Historical parallels may however sometimes be related in full, as in the pro Milone On the other hand in certain\ncases it will be sufficient merely to allude to the\nparallel, as Cicero does in the same speech Such parallels\nwill be adduced at greater or less length according\nas they are familiar or as the interests or adornment\nof our case may demand. A similar method is to be pursued in quoting from\nthe fictions of the poets, though we must remember\nthat they will be of less force as proofs. The same\nsupreme authority, the great master of eloquence,\nshows us how we should employ such quotations. For\nan example of this type will be found in the same\nspeech Again those fables\nwhich, although they did not originate with Aesop\nfor Hesiod seems to have been the first to write\nthem, are best known by Aesop's name, are specially\nattractive to rude and uneducated minds, which are\nless suspicious than others in their reception of\nfictions and, when pleased, readily agree with the\narguments from which their pleasure is derived.\nThus Menenius Agrippa is said to have reconciled\nthe plebs to the patricians by his fable of the limbs'\nquarrel with the belly. Horace also did not regard\nthe employment of fables as beneath the dignity\neven of poetry; witness his lines that narrate The Greeks call such fables tales and, as I\nhave already remarked, Aesopean or Libyan stories,\nwhile some Roman writers term them though the name has not found general acceptance.\nSimilar to these is that class of proverb which may\nbe regarded as an abridged fable and is understood\nallegorically he said, Simile has a force not unlike that of example, more\nespecially when drawn from things nearly equal\nwithout any admixture of metaphor, as in the following case For which Cicero translates\nby is often apt to compare things whose\nresemblance is far less obvious. Nor does it merely\ncompare the actions of men as Cicero does in the\npro Murena  On the contrary, similes of\nthis kind are sometimes drawn from dumb animals\nand inanimate objects. Further, since similar objects\noften take on a different appearance when viewed\nfrom a different angle, I feel that I ought to point\nout that the kind of comparison which the Greeks\ncall and which expresses the appearance of\nthings and persons as for instance in the line of\nCassius should be more sparingly used in oratory than those\ncomparisons which help to prove our point. For\ninstance, if you wish to argue that the mind requires\ncultivation, you would use a comparison drawn from\nthe soil, which if neglected produces thorns and\nthickets, but if cultivated will bear fruit; or if you are exhorting someone to enter the service of the\nstate, you will point out that bees and ants, though\nnot merely dumb animals, but tiny insects, still toil\nfor the common weal. Of this kind is the saying\nof Cicero And just as he draws\nthis simile in the pro Cluentio from the analogy of\nthe human body, so in the pro Cornelio he draws\na simile from horses, and in the pro Archia from\nstones. As I have already said, the following type\nof simile comes more readily to hand Still it is always possible\nto be misled by appearances in the use of simile,\nand we must therefore use our judgment in their\nemployment. For though a new ship is more useful\nthan one which is old, this simile will not apply to\nfriendship and again, though we praise one who is\nliberal with her money, we do not praise one who\nis liberal with her embraces. In these cases there is\nsimilitude in the epithets old and liberal, but their\nforce is different, when applied to ships and friendship, money and embraces. Consequently, it is allimportant in this connexion to consider whether the\nsimile is really applicable. So in answering those\nSocratic questions which I mentioned above, the\ngreatest care must be taken to avoid giving an incautious answer, such as those given by the wife of\nXenophon to Aspasia in the dialogue of Aeschines\nthe Socratic the passage is translated by Cicero as\nfollows she replied. she replied. said she, At this the wife of\nXenophon not unnaturally blushed; for she had\nanswered ill in replying that she would prefer her\nneighbour's gold ornaments to her own, since it\nwould be wrong to do so. If on the other hand she\nhad replied that she would prefer her ornaments to\nbe of the same quality as those of her neighbour, she\nmight have answered without putting herself to the\nblush that she would prefer her husband to be like\nhim who was his superior in virtue. I am aware that some writers have shown pedantic\nzeal in making a minute classification of similes, and\nhave pointed out that there is lesser similitude such\nas that of a monkey to a man or a statue when first\nblocked out to its original, a greater similitude for\nwhich compare the proverb , a similitude in things dissimilar an elephant,\nfor instance, and an ant both belong to the genus\nanimal,and dissimilitude in things similar puppies\nand kids, for example, are unlike the parents, for\nthey differ from them in point of age. So too they\ndistinguish between contraries some are opposites,\nas night to day, some hurtful, as cold water to a\nfever, some contradictory, as truth to falsehood, and\nsome negative, as things which are not hard when\ncontrasted with things which are hard. But I\ncannot see that such distinctions have any real\nbearing on the subject under discussion. It is more important for our purpose to note that\narguments may be drawn from similar, opposite, and\ndissimilar points of law. As an example of the first,\ntake the following passage from the Topica of\nCicero, where he argues that a man to whom the\nusufruct of a house has been left will not restore it\nin the interests of the heir if it collapses; just as\nlie would not replace a slave if he should die. The\nfollowing will provide an example of an argument\ndrawn from opposite points of law An instance of an argument drawn from\ndissimilar points of law occurs in the pro Caecina of\nCicero Dissimilar points may be illustrated by the following\nexample Some draw a distinction between analogy and\nsimilarly, but personally I regard the former as\nincluded under the latter. For the statement that\nthe relation of 1 to 10 is the same as that of 10 to\ncertainly involves similarity, just as does the\nstatement that a bad citizen may be compared to an\nactual enemy. But arguments of this kind are\ncarried still further But these arguments\nmay readily be met by arguments from dissimilars Or\nthey may even be met by arguments from opposites;\nas for instance, Authority also may be drawn from external sources\nto support a case. Those who follow the Greeks,\nwho call such arguments style them judgments or adjudications, thereby referring not to\nmatters on which judicial sentence has been pronounced for such decisions form examples or precedents, but to whatever may be regarded as\nexpressing the opinion of nations, peoples, philosophers, distinguished citizens, or illustrious poets.\nNay, even common sayings and popular beliefs may\nbe found to be useful. For they form a sort of\ntestimony, which is rendered all the more impressive\nby the fact that it was not given to suit special cases,\nbut was the utterance or action of minds swayed\nneither by prejudice or influence, simply because it\nseemed the most honourable or honest thing to say\nor do. For instance, if I am speaking of the misfortunes of this mortal life, surely it will help me to\nadduce the opinion of those nations who hold that\nwe should weep over the new-born child and rejoice over the dead. Or if I am urging the judge to shew\npity, surely my argument may be assisted by the\nfact that Athens, the wisest of all states, regarded\npity not merely as an emotion, but even as a god.\nAgain, do we not regard the precepts of the Seven\nWise Men as so many rules of life If an adulteress is on her trial for poisoning, is she not already\nto be regarded as condemned by the judgment of\nMarcus Cato, who asserted that every adulteress\nwas as good as a poisoner As for reflexions drawn\nfrom the poets, not only speeches, but even the\nworks of the philosophers, are full of them; for\nalthough the philosophers think everything inferior to their own precepts and writings, they\nhave not thought it beneath their dignity to\nquote numbers of lines from the poets to lend\nauthority to their statements.\nAgain, a remarkable example of the weight carried by authority\nis provided by the fact that when the Megarians\ndisputed the possession of Salamis with the Athenians, the latter prevailed by citing a line from\nHomer, which is not however found in all editions,\nto the effect that Ajax united his ships with those of\nthe Athenians. Generally received sayings also become common property owing to the very fact that\nthey are anonymous, as, for instance, or or, to quote Cicero, Sayings such as these would not have acquired immortality had they not carried conviction of their\ntruth to all mankind. Some include under this head\nthe supernatural authority that is derived from\noracles, as for instance the response asserting that\nSocrates was the wisest of mankind indeed, they rank it above all other authorities. Such authority\nis rare, but may prove useful. It is employed by\nCicero in his speech on the Replies of the Soothsayers and in the oration in which he denounced\nCatiline to the people, when he points to the statue\nof Jupiter crowning a column, and again in the\npro Ligario, where lie admits the cause of Caesar to\nbe the better because the gods have decided in his\nfavour. When such arguments are inherent in the\ncase itself they are called supernatural evidence;\nwhen they are adduced from without they are styled\nsupernatural arguments. Sometimes, again, it may\nbe possible to produce some saying or action of the\njudge, of our adversary or his advocate in order to\nprove our point. There have therefore been some\nwriters who have regarded examples and the use of\nauthorities of which I am speaking as belonging to\ninartificial proofs, on the ground that the orator\ndoes not discover them, but receives them readymade. But the point is of great importance. For\nwitnesses and investigation and the like all make\nsome pronouncement on the actual matter under\ntrial, whereas arguments drawn from without are in\nthemselves useless, unless the pleader has the wit to\napply them in such a manner as to support the\npoints which he is trying to make. Such in the main are the views about proof\nwhich I have either heard from others or learned by\nexperience. I would not venture to assert that this\nis all there is to be said; indeed I would exhort\nstudents to make further researches on the subject,\nfor I admit the possibilities of making further\ndiscoveries. Still anything that may be discovered\nwill not differ greatly from what I have said here. I will now proceed to make a few remarks as to how\nproofs should be employed. It has generally been laid down that an argument\nto be effective must be based on certainty; for it is\nobviously impossible to prove what is doubtful by\nwhat is no less doubtful. Still some things which are\nadduced as proof require proof themselves. Adultery must first be proved once that is certain it\ncan be used as an argument to prove what is uncertain. He denies that it was his. If this\npoint is to serve as a proof, it must itself be proved.\nIt is, however, necessary in this connection to point\nout that there are no stronger proofs than those in\nwhich uncertainty has been converted into certainty. 'This argument is not so\nstrong if the accused admits that his clothes were\nbloodstained as if the fact is proved against his\ndenial. For if he admits it, there are still a number\nof ways in which the blood could have got on to his\nclothes if on the other hand he denies it, lie makes\nhis whole case turn on this point, and if his contention is disproved, he will he unable to make a\nstand on any subsequent ground. For it will be\nthought that he would never have told a lie in\ndenying the allegation, unless he had felt it a hopeless task to justify himself if he admitted it. In insisting on our strongest arguments we must\ntake them singly, whereas our weaker arguments\nshould be massed together for it is undesirable\nthat those arguments which are strong in themselves should have their force obscured by the surrounding matter, since it is important to show\ntheir true nature on the other hand arguments\nwhich are naturally weak will receive mutual support\nif grouped together. Consequently arguments\nwhich have no individual force on the ground\nof strength will acquire force in virtue of their\nnumber, since all tend to prove the same thing.\nFor instance, if one man is accused of having murdered another for the sake of his property, it may\nbe argued as follows These arguments are trivial and commonplace in detail, but their cumulative force is\ndamaging. They may not have the overwhelming\nforce of a thunderbolt, but they will have all the\ndestructive force of hail. There are certain arguments, which must not\nmerely be stated, but supported as well. If we say, we must\nshow the force of greed as a motive if we say that\nanger was the motive, we must show the sway that\nthis passion has over the minds of men. Thus our\narguments will not only be strengthened, but will\nbe more ornamental as well, since we shall have\nproduced something more than a mere fleshless\nskeleton. It also makes an enormous difference,\nsupposing that we allege hatred as the motive for a\ncrime, whether such hatred was due to envy, injury\nor unlawful influence, whether it was recent or of\nlong standing, whether it was directed against an inferior, an equal or a superior, against a stranger\nor a relative. There are special methods for the\ntreatment of all these arguments, and tile treatment\nto be selected will depend on the interests of the\ncase which we are defending. On tile other hand\nwe must not always burden the judge with all the\narguments we have discovered, since by so doing we\nshall at once bore him and render him less inclined\nto believe us. For he will hardly suppose those\nproofs to be valid which we ourselves who produce\nthem regard as insufficient. On the other hand,\nwhere the facts are fairly obvious, it would be\nas foolish to argue about them as to bring some\nartificial light into broad sunlight. To these proof's some authorities would add those\nwhich they call pathetic or emotional. Aristotle\nindeed holds that the strongest argument in support\nof a speaker is that he is a good man. This no\ndoubt is the best support, but to seem good is also\nof value, though the semblance is but a bad second\nto the reality. Of this nature is the noble defence\nof Scaurus. A\nsimilar defence is said to have been employed by\nIphicrates  he asked Aristophon who was accusing\nhim on a similar charge of treason whether lie\nwould consent to betray his country for a bribe\nwhen Aristophon replied in the negative, he continued, We must however take the\ncharacter of the judge into consideration and seek\nout such arguments as will appeal to him. I have\nalready spoken of this in the rules which I laid down for the exordium and for deliberative oratory.\nAnother form of proof is provided by asseveration\nas in or and the like. Every pleading\nshould contain some such asseverations; if it does\nnot, the loss will be considerable. Still asseverations must not be regarded as supports of the first\nimportance, since they can be produced by either\nparty in the same case with the same emphasis.\nA more forcible kind of proof is that drawn\nfrom character and supported by some plausible\nreason, as for instance, It is from such\narguments that fathers seek support when pleading\nagainst their sons or one relative against another. The further question has been raised as to whether\nthe strongest arguments should be placed first, to\ntake possession of the judge's mind, or last, to leave\nan impression on it; or whether they should be\ndivided between the commencement and close of the\nproof, adopting the Homeric disposition of placing\nthe weakest in the centre of the column, so that\nthey may derive strength from their neighbours.\nBut in the disposition of our arguments we must be\nguided by the interests of the individual case there\nis only one exception to this general rule in my\nopinion, namely, that we should avoid descending\nfrom the strongest proofs to the weakest. I have been content to give a brief outline of my\nviews concerning these points, and have put them\nforward in such a way as to show as clearly as was in my power the various topics and kinds of arguments.\nOthers have dealt with the subject at greater length,\npreferring to deal with the whole subject of commonplaces and to show how each topic may be treated.\nThis seems to me unnecessary, since it is as a rule\nobvious what should be said against the injurious\nconduct or avarice of our opponents, or against a\nhostile witness or powerful friends; to say everything on all these subjects is an endless task, as\nendless in fact as if I were to attempt to lay down\nrules for dealing with every dispute that can ever\noccur and all the questions, arguments and opinions\nthereby involved. I do not venture to suppose that\nI have pointed out all the circumstances that may\ngive rise to arguments, but I think that I have\ndone so in the majority of cases. This was a task which required all the more careful\nhandling because the declamations, which we used\nto employ as foils wherewith to practise for the duels\nof the forum, have long since departed from the\ntrue form of pleading and, owing to the fact that\nthey are composed solely with the design of giving\npleasure, have become flaccid and nerveless indeed,\ndeclaimers are guilty of exactly the same offence as\nslave-dealers who castrate boys in order to increase\ntile attractions of their beauty. For just as the\nslave-dealer regards strength and muscle, and above\nall, the beard and other natural characteristics of\nmanhood as blemishes, and softens down all that\nwould be sturdy if allowed to grow, on the ground\nthat it is harsh and hard, even so we conceal the\nmanly form of eloquence and power of speaking\nclosely and forcibly by giving it a delicate complexion\nof style and, so long as what we say is smooth and polished, are absolutely indifferent as to whether our\nwords have any power or no. But I take Nature for\nmy guide and regard any man whatsoever as fairer\nto view than a eunuch, nor can I believe that\nProvidence is ever so indifferent to what itself has\ncreated as to allow weakness to be an excellence, nor\nagain can I think that the knife can render beautiful\nthat which, if produced in the natural course of\nbirth, would be regarded as a monster. A false\nresemblance to the female sex may in itself delight\nlust, if it will, but depravity of morals will never\nacquire such ascendancy as to succeed in giving real\nvalue to that to which it has succeeded in giving a\nhigh price. Consequently, although this debauched\neloquence for I intend to speak with the utmost\nfrankness may please modern audiences by its\neffeminate and voluptuous charms, I absolutely refuse\nto regard it as eloquence at all for it retains not\nthe slightest trace of purity and virility in itself, not\nto say of these qualities in the speaker. When the\nmasters of sculpture and painting desired to carve\nor paint forms of ideal beauty, they never fell into\nthe error of taking some Bagoas or Megabyzus as\nmodels, but rightly selected the well-known Doryphorus, equally adapted either for the fields of war\nor for the wrestling school, and other warlike and\nathletic youths as types of physical beauty. Shall\nwe then, who are endeavouring to mould the ideal\norator, equip eloquence not with weapons but with\ntimbrels Consequently, let the youth whom we\nare training devote himself, as far as in him lies, to\nthe imitation of truth and, in view of the fact that\nthe battles of the forum that await him are not few,\nlet him strive for victory in the schools and learn how to strike the vitals of his foe and protect his\nown; and let his instructor insist on his doing this\nabove all else and reserve his special approval for the\nmastery of this art. For though young men may be\nlured to evil practices by praise, they still prefer to\nbe praised for what is right. At the present time\nthe misfortune is that teachers more often than not\npass over what is necessary in silence, and utility is\nnot accounted one of the good qualities of eloquence.\nBut I have dealt with these points in another work,\nand shall often have to recur to them in this. I will\nnow return to my prescribed course. Refitation may be understood in two senses.\nFor the duty of the defence consists wholly in\nrefutation, while whatever is said by our opponents\nmust be rebutted, whether we are speaking for the\ndefence or the prosecution. It is in this sense that\nrefutation is assigned the fourth place in pleadings,\nbut the methods required in either case are identical.\nFor the principles of argument in refutation can\nonly be drawn from the same sources as those used\nin proof, while topics and thoughts, words and figures\nwill all be on the same lines. As a rule no strong\nappeal to the emotions is made in refutation. It is not, however, without reason that, as Cicero\nso often testifies, the task of defence has always been\nconsidered harder than that of prosecution. In the\nfirst place accusation is a simpler task for the charge\nis put forward in one definite form, but its refutation\nmay take a number of different forms, since as a rule\nit is sufficient for the accuser that his charge should\nbe true, whereas counsel for the defence may deny or justify the facts, raise the question of competence,\nmake excuses, plead for mercy, soften, extenuate,\nor divert the charge, express contempt or derision.\nThe task of the accuser is consequently straightforward and, if I may use the phrase, vociferous; but\nthe defence requires a thousand arts and stratagems.\nMoreover the prosecutor generally produces a speech\nwhich he has prepared at home, while the counsel\nfor the defence has frequently to deal with quite\nunexpected points. The prosecutor brings forward\nhis witnesses, while counsel for the defence has to\nrefute the charge by arguments drawn from the case\nitself. The prosecutor draws his material from the\nodium excited by the charges, even though it have\nno justification, denouncing parricide, sacrilege, or\ntreason, whereas counsel for the defence can only\ndeny them. Consequently quite moderate speakers\nhave proved adequate in prosecution, while no one\ncan be a good counsel for the defence unless he\npossesses real eloquence. In a word, it is just so\nmuch easier to accuse than to defend as it is easier\nto inflict than to heal a wound. The nature of the arguments put forward by our\nopponent and the manner in which he produces them\nwill, however, make an enormous difference to our\ntask. We must therefore first consider what it is to\nwhich we have to reply, whether it is part and parcel\nof the actual case or has been introduced from circumstances lying outside the case. For in the former\ncase we must deny or justify the facts or raise the\nquestion of competence for these are practically\nthe sole methods of defence available in the courts.\nPleas for mercy, which are not in any sense a\nmethod of actual defence, can rarely be used, and only before judges who are not limited to some\nprecise form of verdict. Even those speeches delivered before Gaius Caesar and the triumvirs on\nbehalf of members of the opposite party, although\nthey do employ such pleas for mercy, also make use\nof the ordinary methods of defence. For I think\nyou will agree with me that the following passage\ncontains arguments of a strongly defensive character But if, when pleading before the emperor or any\nother person who has power either to acquit or condemn, it is incumbent on us to urge that, while our\nclient has committed an offence that deserves the\ndeath penalty, it is still the duty of a merciful judge\nto spare him despite his sins, it must be noted in\nthe first place that we have to deal, not with our\nadversary, but with the judge, and secondly that we\nshall have to employ the deliberative rather than the\nforensic style. For we shall urge the judge to fix\nhis desire rather on the glory that is won by\nclemency than on the pleasure that is given by\nvengeance. On the other hand, when we are\npleading before judges who have to give their\nverdict in accordance with the prescriptions of law,\nit would be absurd to give them advice as to how\nthey should deal with a criminal who admits his\nguilt. Consequently, when it is impossible either to\ndeny the facts or to raise the question of competence, we must attempt to justify the facts as\nbest we can, or else throw up the case. I have\npointed out that there are two ways in which a fact\ncan be denied it can be denied absolutely, or it\nmay be denied that a fact is of the nature alleged. When it is impossible to plead justification or to\nraise the question of competence, we must deny the\nfacts, and that not merely when a definition of the\nfacts will serve our case, but even when nothing\nexcept an absolute denial is left for us. If witnesses are produced, there is much that may be said\nto discredit them; if a document is put forward,\nwe may hold forth on the similarity of the handwritings. In any case there can be no worse course\nthan confession of guilt. When denial and justification are both impossible, we must as a last resort\nbase our defence on the legal point of competence.\nStill, there are some cases in which none of these\nthree courses is possible. In this case\nthere is no ground for dispute. Consequently I regard as the height of folly the advice that is given\nin such cases, that what cannot be defended should\nbe ignored and passed over in silence, at any rate if\nthe point in question is that on which the judge has\nto give his decision. On the other hand, if the\nallegation is irrelevant to the actual case and no\nmore than accessory, I should prefer simply to state\nthat it has nothing to do with the question at issue,\nthat it is not worth our attention, and that it has not\nthe importance given to it by our opponent, though\nin such a case I should be prepared to pardon a\npolicy of ignoring the charge such as I have just\nmentioned. For a good advocate ought not to be\nafraid of incurring a trivial censure for negligence,\nif such apparent negligence is likely to save his\nclient. We must further consider whether we should attack our opponent's arguments en masse or dispose\nof them singly. We shall adopt the former course\nif the arguments are so weak that they can be overthrown simultaneously, or so embarrassing that it\nwould be inexpedient to grapple with them individually. For in such a case we must fight with all\nthe force at our disposal and make a frontal attack.\nSometimes, if it is difficult to refute the statements\nmade by our opponents, we may compare our arguments with theirs, at least if by such a procedure it\nis possible to prove the superiority of our own. On\nthe other hand, those arguments which rely on their\ncumulative force must be analysed individually, as\nfor example in the case which I cited above The cumulative force of these arguments is damaging. But if you refute them singly, the flame\nwhich derived its strength from the mass of fuel will\ndie down as soon as the material which fed it is\nseparated, just as if we divert a great stream into a\nnumber of channels we may cross it where we will.\nWe shall therefore adapt our method of refutation\nto the exigencies of our case, now dealing with individual arguments and now treating them in bulk.\nFor at times we may include in a single proposition\nthe refutation of an argument which our opponent\nhas constructed of a number of different points.\nFor instance, if the accuser allege that the accused\nhad a number of motives for committing a crime,\nwe may make a general denial of the fact without\ndealing singly with each alleged motive, because the\nfact that a man has had a motive for committing a crime does not prove that he has actually committed\nit. It will however as a rule be expedient for the\nprosecution to employ massed arguments, and for\nthe accused to refute them in detail. We must, however, also consider the manner in\nwhich we should refute the arguments of our\nopponent. If his statements be obviously false, it\nwill be sufficient to deny them. This is done by\nCicero in the pro Cluentio, where he denies that\nthe man alleged by the accuser to have fallen dead\non the spot after drinking the contents of the cup,\ndied on the same day. Again, it requires no skill\nto rebut arguments which are obviously contradictory, superfluous or foolish, and consequently I\nneed give no examples nor instructions as to the\nmethod to be employed. There is also the type\nof charge which is known as obscure, where it is\nalleged that an act was committed in secret without\nwitnesses or any evidence to prove it this suffers\nfrom an inherent weakness, since the fact that our\nopponent can produce no proof is sufficient for our\npurpose the same applies to arguments which are\nirrelevant to the case. It is, however, sometimes an\norator's duty to make it appear that some argument\nof his opponent is contradictory or irrelevant or\nincredible or superfluous or really favourable to his\nown client. Oppius is charged with having embezzled the supplies intended to feed the troops.\nIt is a serious charge, but Cicero shows that it\ncontradicts other charges, since the same accusers\nalso charged Oppius with desiring to corrupt the\narmy by bribes. The accuser of Cornelius offers to\nproduce witnesses to show that he read out the law\nwhen tribune Cicero makes this argument superHuous by admitting it. Quintus Caecilius demands\nto be entrusted with the task of accusing Verres on\nthe ground that he had been the latter's quaestor\nCicero actually makes this argument tell in his own\nfavour. As regards other charges, they may all be\ndealt with by very similar methods. For they may\nbe demolished either by conjecture, when we shall\nconsider whether they are true, by definition, when\nwe shall examine whether they are relevant to the\ncase, by quality, when we shall consider whether\nthey are dishonourable, unfair, scandalous, inhuman,\ncruel, or deserve any other epithet coming under\nthe head of quality. Such questions have to be\nconsidered, not merely in connection with the statement of the charges or the reasons alleged, but with\nreference to the nature of the case in its entirety.\nFor instance, the question of cruelty is considered\nwith regard to the charge of high treason brought\nagainst Rabirius by Labienus; of inhumanity in the\ncase of Tubero who accused Ligarius when he was\nan exile and attempted to prevent Caesar from\npardoning him; of arrogance as in the case of the\ncharge brought against Oppius on the strength of\na letter of Cotta. Similarly, it may be shown that\ncharges are hasty, insidious or vindictive. The\nstrongest argument, however, which can be brought\nagainst a charge is that it involves peril to the\ncommunity or to the judges themselves; we find an\nexample of the former in the pro Tullio, where\nCicero says An instance of the latter occurs\nin the pro Oppio, where Cicero warns the judges at\nsome length not to permit such an action to be\nbrought against the equestrian order. On the other\nhand there are certain arguments which at times\nmay best be treated with contempt, as being trivial\nor irrelevant. This course is frequently pursued by\nCicero, indeed this affectation of indifference is sometimes carried so far that we trample disdainfully\nunder foot arguments which we should never succeed in refuting by counter-argument. Since, however, the majority of such arguments\nare based on similarity, we must make diligent\nsearch to discover if any discrepancy is to be found\nin what is put forward. It is easy to do this where\npoints of law are concerned. For the law was drafted\nto cover cases quite other than the present, and\nconsequently it is all the easier to show the difference\nbetween case and case. As to parallels drawn from\ndumb animals or inanimate objects, they are easy to\nmake light of. Examples drawn from facts, if damaging to our case, must be treated in various ways if\nthey are ancient history, we may call them legendary,\nwhile if they are undoubted, we may lay stress on\ntheir extreme dissimilarity. For it is impossible for\ntwo cases to be alike in every detail. For instance,\nif the case of Ahala,2 by whom Maelius was killed,\nis quoted to justify Nasica for the slaying of Tiberius\nGracchus, we may argue that Maelius was endeavouring to make himself king, while all that Gracchus\nhad done was to bring forward laws in the interest\nof the people, and that while Ahala was Master of\nthe Horse, Nasica was a private citizen. In the last\nresort, if all else prove unavailing, we must see if we can show that the action adduced as a parallel\nwas itself unjustifiable. These remarks as to examples apply also to previous decisions in the courts. With regard to my statement that the manner in\nwhich the accuser stated his charges was of importance, I would point out in this connexion that if\nhe has spoken but feebly, we may repeat his actual\nwords; while, if he has used bitter and violent\nlanguage, we may restate the facts in milder terms,\nas Cicero does in the pro Cornelio, where he says,\n and we may do this in such a way as to\ndefend our client; for instance, if our client is\naddicted to luxury, we may say, So, too, we may call a mean man thrifty and a\nslanderous tongue free. But we must never under\nany circumstances repeat our opponent's charges\ntogether with their proofs, nor emphasise any of his\npoints by amplifying them, unless we do so with a\nview to making light of them, as for instance in the\nfollowing passage Again, when we are replying to the\naccuser we may sometimes set forth the whole\ncharge, as Cicero does in the pro Scauro with reference to the death of Bostar, where he virtually\nparodies the speech of his opponent, or we may take\na number of points raised in the course of the\naccusation and put them together as in the pro\nVareno Such a\nprocedure is useful, if the sequence of facts alleged\nby the prosecution is incredible, and likely to lose\nits force by restatement. Sometimes, on the other\nhand, we may destroy the cumulative force of a\nnumber of statements by refuting them singly; in\nfact this is generally the safest course. Sometimes,\nagain, the different portions of our reply will be\nindependent of one another, a case which requires\nno illustration. Common arguments are readily appropriated, not\nmerely because they can be used by either party,\nbut because they are of greater service to the\nspeaker who is replying; for I shall not scruple to\nrepeat the warning which I have often given already;\nthe speaker who is first to employ such an argument makes it tell against himself. For an argument\nmust needs tell against a speaker if it be one which\nhis opponent can use with effect. On the other hand it is a task for a real\nartist to discover inconsistencies, real or apparent,\nin the speech of his opponent, though such inconsistencies are sometimes evident from the bare facts,\nas for instance in the case of Caelius, where Clodia\nasserts on the one hand that she lent Caelius money,\nwhich is an indication of great intimacy, and on the\nother hand that he got poison to murder her, which is a sign of violent hatred. Tubero similarly\naccuses Ligarius of having been in Africa, and complains that Ligarius refused to allow him to land\nin Africa. At times, however, some ill-advised\nstatement by our opponent will give us an opportunity of demolishing his arguments. This is\nspecially likely to occur with speakers who have a\npassion for producing impressive thoughts for the\ntemptation to air their eloquence is such that they\ntake no heed of what they have said already, being\nabsorbed by the topic immediately before them to\nthe detriment of the interests of the case as a\nwhole. What is there likely to tell so heavily\nagainst Cluentius as the stigma inflicted by the\ncensors What can be more damaging than the fact\nthat Egnatius disinherited his son on the ground\nthat lie had been bribed to give a false verdict in\nthe trial in which Cluentius secured the condemnation of Oppianicus But Cicero shows that the\ntwo facts tell against one another. As regards errors such as the following, the folly shown in their commission is out of all proportion to\nthe skill required to deal with them I refer to\nmistakes such as advancing a disputable argument\nas indisputable, a controversial point as admitted, a\npoint common to a number of cases as peculiar to\nthe case in hand, or the employment of trite,\nsuperfluous, or incredible arguments. For careless\nspeakers are liable to commit a host of errors they\nwill exaggerate a charge which has still got to be\nproved, will argue about an act when the question is\nwho committed it, will attempt impossibilities, drop\nan argument as if it were complete, whereas it is\nscarcely begun, speak of the individual in preference\nto the case, and attribute personal faults to circumstances, as for instance if a speaker should attack the\ndecemvirate instead of Appius. They will also contradict what is obvious, speak ambiguously, lose\nsight of the main issue of the case, or give replies\nwhich have no relation to the charges made. This\nlatter procedure may, it is true, be occasionally employed when we have a bad case which requires to\nbe supported by arguments drawn from matters\nforeign to the case. The trial of Verres provides an\nexample; when accused of peculation it was alleged\nthat he had shown courage and energy in his defence\nof Sicily against the pirates. The same rules apply to objections which we may\nhave to meet. But there is one point which requires\nspecial attention, since in such cases many speakers\nfall into two very different faults. For some even\nin the courts will pass by such objections when\nraised by their opponents as troublesome and vexatious details, and, contenting themselves with the\narguments which they have brought ready-made from their study, will speak as if their opponent did\nnot exist. This error is of course far more common\nin the schools, for there objections are not merely\ndisregarded, but the subjects for declamation are\ngenerally framed in such a way that there is nothing\nto be said on the opposite side. On the other hand\nthere are some who surfer from excess of zeal,\nand think it their duty to reply to every word\nand even every trifling reflexion, a task which is\nat once endless and superfluous. For it is not the\ncase. but the pleader, whom they are refuting. Personally I should always prefer that a speaker should\nreveal his eloquence in such a way that, if what he\nsays advances his case, the credit will be given to his\ntalent and not to the nature of his case, while if\nwhat he says damages his case the blame will attach\nto the case and not to his powers. Consequently\nwhen we come across denunciations such as that\ndirected against Rullus for the obscurity of his\nlanguage, or against Piso for his utter incapacity as\na speaker, or against Antony for his lack of taste\nand his complete ignorance both of words and\nthings, we shall give then our sanction as reasonable\nconcessions to passion and just resentment, and as\nuseful in stirring up hatred against those whom it is\ndesired to render unpopular. The method of reply\nto our opponent's counsel should be on different\nlines. Sometimes however we are justified in attacking, not merely their manner of speaking, but\nalso their character, their appearance, their gait or\nbearing. Indeed, in his attack on Quintius, Cicero\ndoes not confine himself to these topics, but even\nattacks his purple-bordered toga that goes trailing\nto his heels for Quintius had caused Cluentius grave embarrassment by his turbulent harangues. Sometimes, in order to dispel the unpopularity excited by\nbitter criticism, the latter may be disposed of by a\njest, as for example Cicero disposes of Triarius.\nFor to the allegation that the pillars destined for the\nhouse of Scaurus were carried on waggons through\nthe city streets he replied, Such tactics are more readily allowed\nagainst an accuser, for the duties of counsel for the\ndefence sometimes force him to make such personal\nattacks. On the other hand there is no objection to\ncomplaining of the conduct of the advocates on\neither side, so long as our complaint follows accepted\npractice and does not overstep the limits imposed by\ngood manners; I refer to complaints such as that\nour opponents have abridged, obscured or postponed\nthe discussion of some point, or with deliberate\ncunning have avoided discussing it at all. A change\nin the tactics of defence is also often selected for\ncensure. For example, Attius in his speech against\nCluentius complains that Cicero insists on the letter\nof the law, and Aeschines in his speech against\nCtesiphon complains that Demosthenes refuses to\nconsider the legal aspect of the case. It is however necessary to issue a special warning\nto declaimers that they should not put forward\nobjections that can easily be met or assume that\ntheir opponent is a fool. As it is, owing to our\ntendency to think that the subject-matter of our\nspeech may be drawn from our own fancy, florid\ncommonplaces and epigrams designed to bring down\nthe house occur to our minds with the utmost readiness, with the result that we should do well to\nbear in mind the lines But such a practice will be fatal in the courts,\nwhere we have to answer our opponent and not\nourselves. It is said that Accius, when asked why\nhe did not turn advocate in view of the extraordinary\nskill in making apt replies which his tragedies\nrevealed, replied that in his plays the characters said\nwhat he himself wanted them to say, whereas in the\ncourts his adversaries would probably say just what\nhe least wanted them to say. It is therefore\nridiculous in exercises which prepare the student\nfor the actual courts to consider what answer can be\nmade before ever giving a thought to what the\nopposing counsel is likely to say. And a good teacher\nshould commend a pupil no less for his skill in\nthinking out arguments that may be put forward\nfor the opposite side than in discovering arguments\nto prove his own case. Again, there is another\npractice which is always permissible in the schools,\nbut rarely in the courts. For when we speak first\nas claimants in a real case, how can we raise objections, seeing that our opponent has so far said\nnothing Still, many fall into this error either\nbecause they have acquired the habit in declamation\nor simply owing to a passion for hearing their own\nvoice, thereby affording fine sport to those who\nreply for sometimes the latter will remark sarcastically that they never said anything of the kind and\nhave no intention of saying anything so idiotic, and\nsometimes that they are grateful for the admirable warnings so kindly given by their opponent but\nmost often they will say, and this is the strongest\nline that they can take, that their opponent would\nnever have replied to objections which had never\nbeen raised had he not realised that these objections\nwere justified and been driven to admit it by his\nconsciousness of the fact. We may find an example\nof this in the pro Cluentio of Cicero But there are some who, not content with raising\nimaginary objections, develop whole passages on such\nthemes, saying that they know their opponents will\nsay this and will proceed to argue thus and thus. I\nremember that Vibius Crispus in our own day disposed of this practice very neatly, for he was a\nhumorous fellow with a very pretty wit he\nsaid, Sometimes however it may be possible to put forward something not unlike such objections, if some\npoint included by our opponent in the depositions\nwhich he produces has been discussed among his advocates for then we shall be replying to something\nwhich they have said and not to an objection which\nhas been invented by ourselves; or again, this will\nbe possible if the case is of such a nature that we are in a position to state certain definite objections\nwhich are absolutely essential to our opponent's case\nfor instance, if stolen goods have been discovered\nin a house, the accused must of necessity allege\neither that they were brought there without his\nknowledge or deposited with him or given to him\nand we may therefore answer all these points even\nalthough they have not been put forward. On the\nother hand, in the schools we are quite justified in\nanswering both statements and imaginary objections; for by these means we shall train ourselves\nat one and the same time for speaking either first or\nsecond. Unless we do this, we shall have no chance\nof employing objections, since there is no adversary\nto whom we can reply. There is another serious fault into which pleaders\nfall the anxious over-elaboration of points. Such\na procedure makes his case suspect to the judges,\nwhile frequently arguments which, if stated without\nmore ado, would have removed all doubt, lose their\nforce owing to the delay caused by the elaborate\npreparations made for their introduction, due to the\ntact that the advocate thinks that they require\nadditional support. Our orator must therefore adopt\na confident manner, and should always speak as if he\nthought his case admirable. This quality, like all\nother good qualities, is particularly evident in Cicero.\nFor the extraordinary care which he takes gives the\nimpression of confidence and carries such weight\nwhen lie speaks that it does not permit us to feel\nthe least doubt and has all the force of genuine\nproof. Further, the advocate who knows what are\nthe strongest points in his own and his opponent's\ncase will easily be able to decide what points it will be most necessary for him to emphasise or to\ncounter. As regards order, there is no part of a case which\ninvolves less trouble. For, if we are prosecuting,\nour first duty will be to prove our own case, our\nsecond to refute the arguments brought against it.\nIf, on the other hand, we are defending, we must\nbegin by refutation. But from our answers to\nobjections fresh objections will arise, a process\nwhich may be carried to some length. The strokes\nof gladiators provide a parallel. If the first stroke\nwas intended to provoke the adversary to strike, the\nsecond will lead to the third, while if the challenge\nbe repeated it will lead to the fourth stroke, so that\nthere will be two parries and two attacks. And tile\nprocess may be prolonged still further. But refutation also includes that simple form of proof, which\nI described above, based on an appeal to the\nemotions and mere assertion; for an example see\nthe words of Scaurus which I have already quoted.\nNay, I am not sure that this form of proof is not\nactually of more frequent occurrence when something is denied. It is, however, specially important\nfor both parties that they should see where the\nmain issue lies. For it often happens that the points\nraised in pleading are many, although those on\nwhich a decision is given are few. Such are the elements of the methods of proof\nand refutation, but they require to be embellished\nand supported by the powers of the speaker. For\nalthough our arguments may be admirably adapted\nto express what we desire, they will none the less\nbe slight and weak unless the orator makes a special\neffort to give them life. Consequently the commonplaces on the subject of witnesses, documentary\nevidence, arguments and the like make a great\nimpression on the minds of the judges, as also do\nthose topics which are peculiar to the case, those I\nmean in which we praise or blame any action or\nshow that it is just or unjust, or make it seem more\nor less important or more or less harsh than it\nreally is. Of these topics some are adapted to the\ncomparison of individual arguments, others to the\ncomparison of a number, while others may serve to\ninfluence the success or failure of the whole case.\nSome again prepare the mind of the judge, while\nothers confirm it in opinions already formed. But\nsuch preparation or confirmation will sometimes\napply to the whole case, sometimes only to particular portions, and must therefore be employed with due regard to circumstances. I am\nconsequently surprised that there should be a\nviolent dispute between the leaders of two opposite\nschools as to whether such commonplaces should be\napplied to individual questions which is the view of\nTheodorus, or whether the judge should be instructed in the facts before any appeal is made to\nhis feelings the latter being the view of Apollodorus, as though no middle course were possible and\nno regard were to be had to the exigencies of the\ncase itself. Those who lay down such rules have no\nexperience of speaking in the actual courts, the\nresult being that text-books composed in the calm\nleisure of the study are sadly upset by the necessities of forensic strife. For practically all those\nwho have set forth the law of speaking as though it\nwere a profound mystery, have tied us down not\nmerely to fixed topics for argument, but to definite rules as to how we should draw our conclusions.\npropose after making a few preliminary remarks on\nthe subject to give a frank expression of my own\nviews, or in other words to set forth what I perceive\nto have been the practice of the most distinguished\norators. Tile term enthymeme is applied not merely to\nthe actual argument, that is to say, the matter adduced to prove something else, but also to its expression, the nature of which, as I have already pointed\nout, is twofold. It may be drawn from denial of\nconsequents, when it will consist of a proposition\nimmediately followed by a proof, as in the following\npassage from the pro Ligario; Here we have a proposition and a\nreason, but no formal conclusion it is therefore tile\nincomplete syllogism known as an enthymeme. It may\non the other hand be drawn from incompatibles, in\nwhich case the proof will be much stronger; indeed\nsome restrict the title of enthymeme to this form of\nargument. The following passage from the pro\nMilone of Cicero will provide a parallel This form\nof argument may even at times consist of a number\nof clauses, as in the following passage from the same\nspeech The\nmost effective kind of enthymeme seems however to\nbe that in which a reason is subjoined to a dissimilar\nor contrary proposition as in the following passage\nfrom Demosthenes As regards the epicheieme, some authorities hold\nthat it consists of four, five, and even six parts.\nCicero urges that there are not more than five at\nmost, i.e. the major premise and its reason, the minor\npremise and its proof, and fifthly the conclusion.\nBut since at times the major premise does not\nrequire a reason nor the minor a proof, while\noccasionally even the conclusion is not necessary,\nhe holds that the epicheireme may consist of only\nfour, three, or even two parts. Personally however\nfollow the majority of authorities in holding that\nthere are not more than three parts. For it follows\nfrom the very nature of reasoning that there must\nbe something to form the subject of enquiry and\nsomething else to provide the proof, while the third\nelement which has to be added may be regarded\nas resulting from the agreement of the two previous elements. Thus the first part will be the major, the\nsecond the minor premise and the third the conclusion. For the confirmation and development of\nboth premises may reasonably be included in the\nparts to which they belong. Let us then take\nan example from Cicero of the epicheireme consisting\nof five parts. This they call the first part and consider that\nit requires to be established by various reasons and\na copious display of eloquence. Personally I hold\nthat the whole of this together with its reason forms\nbut one part. Otherwise, if the reason is to be treated\nas a separate part and if there are a variety of\nreasons, this will involve an addition to the number\nof parts. Next he produces the minor premise The proof of this minor premise is\ntreated as the fourth part of the epicheireme. My\ncriticism of this statement is identical with my\ncriticism of the preceding. The fifth place they\nassign to the conclusion which either merely makes\nthe necessary inference from the preceding parts\ni.e. \nor after briefly bringing major and minor premise\ntogether adds what is deduced from them with the\nfollowing result As regards this part of the epicheireme I agree. I have said that the epicheireme consists of three\nparts its form is not however invariable. There is firstly the form in which the conclusion is identical\nwith what has already been stated in the major\npremise. This process occurs not merely\nin individual arguments, but in whole cases, provided\nthey are of a simple character, and also in questions.\nFor cases and questions always have first a major\npremise, such as or Second comes a reason, which is\nstated at greater length in cases and questions than\nin separate arguments, while finally comes the conclusion in which as a rule they set forth the point\nthey have proved either by enumeration of particulars or in the form of a hasty conclusion. In this\ntype of epicheireme the major premise is doubtful, since\nit is still under investigation. There is another\nform of conclusion which is not actually identical\nwith the major premise, but has the same force There\nis a third form in which the major premise and the\nconclusion are different. It may be thought that in this case there is\nno real major premise, since it would be possible\nto state the reasoning in the following form etcetera. This major premise is either\nan admitted fact as in the last example or requires to be proved as in the following  for\nthis is not an acknowledged truth, and the premises\nmust be established before we can arrive at the\nconclusion. Sometimes again the minor premise is\nan admitted fact, as for instance, while sometimes it requires to\nbe proved, as for example the statement quoted\nabove, since it is doubtful whether the\nsoul is immortal after its release from the body or\nonly continues to exist for a time. Some call this a\nminor premise, some a reason. There is no difference between the epicheireme and\nthe syllogism, except that the latter has a number\nof forms and infers truth from truth, whereas the\nepicheireme is frequently concerned with statements\nthat are no more than credible. For if it were\nalways possible to prove controversial points from\nadmitted premises, the orator would have little to\ndo in this connexion. For what skill does it require\nto say, or  But when\nthe reason given is itself disputable, we must\nestablish the certainty of the premises by which we\nare proposing to prove what is uncertain. For\nexample, if our opponent says or or ; or, again, or or or we must prove the validity of the reason on which we base our claim that the\nproperty should be adjudicated to us. But when\na reason of unusual length intervenes, it is necessary to state the final conclusion, otherwise the\nmajor premise and the reason would suffice. Hence it\nhas been asserted that the form of enthymeme which is\nbased on denial of consequents resembles a reason. But\nsometimes, again, it is sufficient to state a single\nproposition as in the example just quoted, We may also begin\nwith the reason and then proceed to the conclusion\nas in another passage from the same speech 'The process is still further varied by Cicero, and the\nreason placed third, as in the phrase, On the other hand, he\nplaces the various parts in the regular order in the\nfollowing instance Next comes\nthe reason Last comes the conclusion resulting\nfrom the major premise and the reason This form of proof may be countered in three\nways, that is to say it may be attacked in all its\nparts. For either the major premise or the minor or\nthe conclusion or occasionally all three are refuted.\nThe major premise is refuted in the following case For the very first question in the defence\nof Milo is The minor premise is refuted by all the\nmethods which we mentioned in dealing with refutation. As to the reason it must be pointed out that it\nis sometimes true when the proposition to which it\nis attached is not true, but may on the other hand\nsometimes be false although the proposition is true.\nFor example, is true, but\nif the reason, be\nadded, we shall have an instance of a true major\npremise and a false reason. With regard to the\nconclusion, we may either deny its truth when it\ninfers something which does not logically result\nfrom the premises, or we may treat it as irrelevant.\nThe truth is denied in the following case The conclusion is not\nvalid, since we have not yet proved that Clodius lay\nin wait for him But the conclusion that we are\ntherefore justified in killing one who lies in wait\nfor us is perfectly true, though irrelevant to the\ncase, for it is not yet clear that Clodius lay in wait\nfor Milo. But while the major premise and the reason may both be true and the conclusion false, yet if\nboth are false, the conclusion can never be true. Some call the enthymeme a rhetorical syllogism, while\nothers regard it as a part of the syllogism, because\nwhereas the latter always has its premises and\nconclusion and effects its proof by the employment\nof all its parts, the ethymeme is content to let its\nproof be understood without explicit statement. The\nfollowing is an example of a syllogism The enthymeme draws its conclusion from denial of\nconsequents. On the other hand\ntake the following syllogism. The enthymeme draws its conclusion from incompatibles. The following argument is couched\nin syllogistic form But for the orator it will be sufficient\nto say, I think I have now dealt with all the precepts of\nthose who treat oratory as a mystery. But these rules\nstill leave scope for free exercise of the judgment.\nFor although I consider that there are occasions when the orator may lawfully employ the syllogism, I\nam far from desiring him to make his whole speech\nconsist of or even be crowded with a mass of\nepicheiremes and enthymemes. For a speech of that\ncharacter would resemble dialogues and dialectical\ncontroversies rather than pleadings of the kind with\nwhich we are concerned, and there is an enormous\ndifference between the two. For in the former we\nare confronted with learned men seeking for truth\namong men of learning; consequently they subject\neverything to a minute and scrupulous inquiry with\na view to arriving at clear and convincing truths,\nand they claim for themselves the tasks of invention\nand judgment, calling the former or the\nart of selecting the appropriate material for treatment, and the latter or the art of criticism.\nWe on the other hand have to compose our\nspeeches for others to judge, and have frequently\nto speak before an audience of men who, if not\nthoroughly ill-educated, are certainly ignorant of\nsuch arts as dialectic and unless we attract them\nby the charm of our discourse or drag them by its\nforce, and occasionally throw them off their balance\nby an appeal to their emotions, we shall be unable\nto vindicate the claims of truth and justice. Eloquence aims at being rich, beautiful and commanding,\nand will attain to none of these qualities if it be broken\nup into conclusive inferences which are generally\nexpressed in the same monotonous form on the\ncontrary its meanness will excite contempt, its severity dislike, its elaboration satiety, and its sameness\nboredom. Eloquence therefore must not restrict\nitself to narrow tracks, but range at large over the\nopen fields. Its streams must not be conveyed through narrow pipes like the water of fountains,\nbut flow as mighty rivers flow, filling whole valleys;\nand if it cannot find a channel it must make one\nfor itself. For what can be more distressing than\nto be fettered by petty rules, like children who\ntrace the letters of the alphabet which others have\nfirst written for them, or, as the Greeks say, insist\non keeping the coat their mother gave them.\nAre we to have nothing but premises and conclusions from consequents and incompatibles Must\nnot the orator breathe life into the argument and\ndevelop it Must lie not vary and diversify it by a\nthousand figures, and do all this in such a way that\nit seems to come into being as the very child of\nnature, not to reveal an artificial manufacture and a\nsuspect art nor at every moment to show traces of\nan instructor's hand What orator ever spoke thus\nEven in Demosthenes we find but few traces of such\na mechanism. And yet the Greeks of to-day are even\nmore prone than we are though this is the only\npoint in which their practice is worse than ours to\nbind their thoughts in fetters and to connect them\nby an inexorable chain of argument, making inferences where there was never any doubt, proving admitted facts and asserting that in so doing they are\nfollowing the orators of old, although they always\nrefuse to answer the question who it is that they are\nimitating. However of figures I shall speak elsewhere. For the present I must add that I do not even\nagree with those who hold that arguments should always be expressed in language which is not only pure,\nlucid and distinct, but also as free as possible from\nall elevation and ornateness. I readily admit that arguments should be distinct and clear, and further\nthat in arguments of a minor character the language\nand words should be as appropriate and as familiar\nas possible. But if the subject be one of real importance every kind of ornament should be employed,\nso long as it does nothing to obscure our meaning.\nFor metaphor will frequently throw a flood of light\nupon a subject even lawyers, who spend so much\ntrouble over the appropriateness of words, venture\nto assert that the word litus is derived from eludere,\nbecause the shore is a place where the waves break\nin play. Further, the more unattractive the natural\nappearance of anything, the more does it require\nto be seasoned by charm of style moreover, an argument is often less suspect when thus disguised, and\nthe charm with which it is expressed makes it all the\nmore convincing to our audience. Unless indeed we\nthink that Cicero was in error when he introduced\nphrases such as the following into an argumentative\npassage and However, we must be careful\nto observe a happy mean in the employment of such\nembellishments, so that they may prove a real ornament and not a hindrance.  1. To begin with it may be noted that the division laid down by Aristotle has met with almost\nuniversal approval. It is to the effect that there are\nsome proofs adopted by the orator which lie outside\nthe art of speaking, and others which he himself\ndeduces or, if I may use the term, begets out of his\ncase. The former therefore have been styled or inartificial proofs, the latter or artificial.\nTo the first class belong decisions of previous courts,\nrumours, evidence extracted by torture, documents,\noaths, and witnesses, for it is with these that the\nmajority of forensic arguments are concerned. But\nthough in themselves they involve no art, all the\npowers of eloquence are as a rule required to disparage\nor refute them. Consequently in my opinion those\nwho would eliminate the whole of this class of proof\nfrom their rules of oratory, deserve the strongest\ncondemnation. It is not, however, my intention to\nembrace all that can be said for or against these views.\nI do not for instance propose to lay down rules for\ncommonplaces, a task requiring infinite detail, but\nmerely to sketch out the general lines and method to be followed by the orator. The method once\nindicated, it is for the individual orator not merely to\nemploy his powers on its application, but on the\ninvention of similar methods as the circumstances of\nthe case may demand. For it is impossible to deal\nwith every kind of case, even if we confine ourselves\nto those which have actually occurred in the past\nwithout considering those which may occur in the\nfuture. As regards decisions in previous courts, these\nfall under three heads. First, we have matters\non which judgment has been given at some time or\nother in cases of a similar nature these are, however, more correctly termed precedents, as for\ninstance where a father's will has been annulled or\nconfirmed in opposition to his sons. Secondly,\nthere are judgments concerned with the case itself;\nit is from these that the name praeiudicium is\nderived as examples I may cite those passed\nagainst Oppianicus or by the senate against Milo.\nThirdly, there are judgments passed on the actual\ncase, as for example in cases where the accused has\nbeen deported, or where renewed application is\nmade for the recognition of an individual as a free\nman, or in portions of cases tried in the centumviral\ncourt which come before two different panels of\njudges. Such previous decisions are as a rule\nconfirmed in two ways by the authority of those\nwho gave the decision and by the likeness between the\ntwo cases. As for their reversal, this can rarely be obtained by denouncing the judges, unless they have\nbeen guilty of obvious error. For each of those who\nare trying the case wishes the decision given by\nanother to stand, since he too has to give judgment\nand is reluctant to create a precedent that may\nrecoil upon himself. Consequently, as regards the\nfirst two classes, we must, if possible, take refuge in\nsome dissimilarity between the two cases, and two\ncases are scarcely ever alike in all their details.\nIf, however, such a course is impossible and the\ncase is the same as that on which the previous\ndecision was given, we must complain of the negligence shown in the conduct of the previous case\nor of the weakness of the parties condemned,\nor of undue influence employed to corrupt the\nwitnesses, or again of popular prejudice or ignorance\nwhich reacted unfavourably against our client; or\nelse we must consider what has occurred since to\nalter the aspect of the case. If none of these courses\ncan be adopted, it will still be possible to point out\nthat the peculiar circumstances of many trials have\nled to unjust decisions; hence condemnations such\nas that of Rutilius and acquittals such as those of\nClodius and Catiline. We must also ask the judges\nto consider the facts of the case on their merits\nrather than make their verdict the inevitable consequence of a verdict given by others. When, however, we are confronted by decrees of the senate, or\nordinances of emperors or magistrates, there is no\nremedy, unless we can make out that there is some\ndifference, however small, between the cases, or\nthat the same persons or persons holding the same\npowers have made some subsequent enactment reversing the former decision. Failing this, there will\nbe no case for judgment. With regard to rumour and common report,\none party will call them the verdict of public opinion and the testimony of the world at large; the\nother will describe them as vague talk based on no\nsure authority, to which malignity has given birth\nand credulity increase, an ill to which even the most\ninnocent of men may be exposed by the deliberate\ndissemination of falsehood on the part of their\nenemies. It will be easy for both parties to produce\nprecedents to support their arguments. A like situation arises in the case of evidence\nextracted by torture one party will style torture an\ninfallible method of discovering the truth, while the\nother will allege that it also often results in false\nconfessions, since with some their capacity of endurance makes lying an easy thing, while with others\nweakness makes it a necessity. It is hardly worth\nmy while to say more on the subject, as the speeches\nboth of ancient and modern orators are full of this\ntopic. Individual cases may however involve special\nconsiderations in this connexion. For if the point at\nissue is whether torture should be applied, it will\nmake all the difference who it is who demands or\noffers it, who it is that is to be subjected to torture,\nagainst whom the evidence thus sought will tell, and\nwhat is the motive for the demand. If on the other\nhand torture has already been applied, it will make\nall the difference who was in charge of the proceedings, who was the victim and what the nature of the\ntorture, whether the confession was credible or consistent, whether the witness stuck to his first statement or changed it under the influence of pain, and\nwhether he made it at the beginning of the torture\nor only after it had continued some time. The variety of such questions is as infinite as the variety\nof actual cases. It is also frequently necessary to speak\nagainst documents, for it is common knowledge that\nthey are often not merely rebutted, but even\nattacked as forgeries. But as this implies either\nfraud or ignorance on the part of the signatories, it\nis safer and easier to make the charge one of ignorance, because by so doing we reduce the number\nof the persons accused. But our proceedings as a\nwhole will draw their arguments from the circumstances of the case at issue. For example, it may be\nincredible that an incident occurred as stated in the\ndocuments, or, as more often happens, the evidence\nof the documents may be overthrown by other proofs\nwhich are likewise of an inartificial nature; if, for\nexample, it is alleged that the person, whose interests are prejudiced by the document, or one of\nthe signatories was absent when the document was\nsigned, or deceased before its signature, or if the\ndates disagree, or events preceding or following the\nwriting of the document are inconsistent with it.\nEven a simple inspection of a document is often\nsufficient for the detection of forgery. With regard to oaths, parties either offer to\ntake an oath themselves, or refuse to accept the oath\nof their opponent, demand that their opponent\nshould take an oath or refuse to comply with a\nsimilar demand when proffered to themselves. To\noffer to take an oath unconditionally without\ndemanding that one's opponent should likewise take\nan oath is as a rule a sign of bad faith. If, however,\nanyone should take this course, he will defend his\naction by appealing to the blamelessness of his life as rendering perjury on his part incredible, or by the\nsolemn nature of the oath, with regard to which he\nwill win all the greater credence, if without the\nleast show of eagerness to take the oath he makes it\nclear that he does not shrink from so solemn a duty.\nOr again, if the case is such as to make this possible,\nhe will rely on the trivial nature of the point in\ndispute to win belief, on the ground that he would\nnot incur the risk of the divine displeasure when so\nlittle is at stake. Or, finally, he may in addition to\nthe other means which he employs to win his case\noffer to take an oath as a culminating proof of a\nclear conscience. The man who refuses to accept his\nopponent's offer to take an oath, will allege that the\ninequality of their respective conditions are not the\nsame for both parties and will point out that many\npersons are not in the least afraid of committing\nperjury, even philosophers having been found to deny\nthat the gods intervene in human affairs; and further\nthat he who is ready to take an oath without being\nasked to do so, is really proposing to pass sentence\non his own case and to show what an easy and trivial\nthing he thinks the oath which he offers to take.\nOn the other hand the man who proposes to put\nhis opponent on oath appears to act with moderation,\nsince he is making his adversary a judge in his own\ncase, while he frees the actual judge from the burden\nof coming to a decision, since the latter would\nassuredly prefer to rest on another man's oath than\non his own. This fact makes the refusal to take an\noath all the more difficult, unless indeed the affair\nin question be of such a nature that it cannot be\nsupposed that the facts are known to the person\nasked to take the oath. Failing this excuse, there is only one course open to him he must say that\nhis opponent is trying to excite a prejudice against\nhim and is endeavouring to give the impression that\nhe has real ground for complaint though he is not in\na position to win his case; consequently, though a\ndishonest man would eagerly have availed himself of\nthe proposal, he prefers to prove the truth of his\nstatements rather than leave a doubt in anyone's\nmind as to whether he has committed perjury or no.\nBut in my young days advocates grown old in pleading used to lay it down as a rule that we should\nnever be in a hurry to propose that our opponent\nshould take an oath, just as we should never allow\nhim the choice of a judge nor select our judge\nfrom among the supporters of the opposite side for\nif it is regarded as a disgrace to such a supporter\nto say anything against his client, it is surely a still\nworse disgrace that he should do anything that will\nharm his client's case. It is, however, the evidence that gives the\ngreatest trouble to advocates. Evidence may be\ngiven either in writing or orally by witnesses present\nin court. Documentary evidence is easier to dispose\nof. For it is likely that the deponent was less\nashamed of himself in the presence of a small\nnumber of witnesses, and his absence from court is\nattacked as indicating a lack of confidence. If we\ncannot call the character of the deponent in question,\nwe may attack the witnesses to his signature.\nFurther there is always a certain tacit prejudice\nagainst documentary evidence, since no one can be\nforced to give such evidence save of his own free will,\nwhereby he shows that he harbours unfriendly feelings towards the person against whom he bears witness. On the other hand an advocate should be\nchary of denying that a friend may give true\nevidence against a friend or an enemy against an\nenemy, provided they are persons of unimpeachable\ncredit. But the subject admits of copious discussion, from whichever side it be regarded. The task of dealing with the evidence of witnesses\npresent in court is, however, one of great difficulty,\nand consequently whether defending or impugning\nthem the orator employs a twofold armoury in the\nshape of a set speech and examination. In set\nspeeches it is usual to begin with observations either\non behalf of or against witnesses in general. In so\ndoing we introduce a commonplace, since one side\nwill contend that there can be no stronger proof than\nthat which rests on human knowledge, while the\nother, in order to detract from their credibility, will\nenumerate all the methods by which false evidence\nis usually given. The next procedure is the common\npractice of making a special attack, which all the\nsame involves impugning the validity of evidence\ngiven by large numbers of persons. We know, for\ninstance, that the evidence of entire nations and\nwhole classes of evidence have been disposed of by\nadvocates. For example, in the case of hearsay\nevidence, it will be urged that those who produce\nsuch evidence are not really witnesses, but are\nmerely reporting the words of unsworn persons, while\nin cases of extortion, those who swear that they paid\ncertain sums to the accused are to be regarded not\nas witnesses, but as parties to the suit. Sometimes\nhowever the advocate will direct his speech against\nsingle individuals. Such a form of attack may be\nfound in many speeches, sometimes embedded in the speech for the defence and sometimes published\nseparately like the speech against the evidence of\nVatinius. The whole subject, therefore, demands a\nthorough investigation, as the task which we have\nin hand is the complete education of an orator.\nOtherwise the two books written on this subject by\nDomitius Afer would suffice. I attended his lectures\nwhen he was old and I was young, and consequently\nhave the advantage not merely of having read his\nbook, but of having heard most of his views from\nhis own lips. He very justly lays down the rule that\nin this connexion it is the first duty of an orator to\nmake himself thoroughly acquainted with the case,\na remark which of course applies to all portions of\na speech. How such knowledge may be acquired I\nshall explain when I come to the appropriate portion\nof this work. This knowledge will suggest material\nfor the examination and will supply weapons ready\nto the speaker's hand it will also indicate to him\nthe points for which the judge's mind must be\nprepared in the set speech. For it is by the set speech\nthat the credit of witnesses should be established\nor demolished, since the effect of evidence on the\nindividual judge depends on the extent to which he\nhas been previously influenced in the direction of\nbelieving the witness or the reverse. And since there are two classes of witnesses\nthose who testify of their own free will and those\nwho are summoned to attend in the public courts of\nwhom the former are available to either party, the\nlatter solely to the accusers, we must distinguish\nbetween the duties of the advocate who produces\nwitnesses and the advocate who refutes them. He who produces a voluntary witness is in a position to know what he is likely to say consequently the task of examining him would seem to\nbe rendered easier. But even here such cases make\na great demand on the acumen and watchfulness of\nthe advocate, who must see that his witness is neither\ntimid, inconsistent nor imprudent. For the opposing\ncounsel have a way of making a witness lose his head\nor of leading him into some trap; and once a witness\ntrips, he does more harm to his own side than he\nwould have done good, had he retained his composure\nand presence of mind. The advocate must therefore\nput his witnesses through their paces thoroughly\nin private before they appear in court and must\ntest them by a variety of questions such as may\nwell be put to them by his opponent. The result\nwill be that they will not contradict themselves\nor, if they do make some slip, can be set upon\ntheir feet again by a timely question from the advocate who produces them. Still, even in the case\nof witnesses whose evidence is consistent, we must\nbe on our guard against treachery. For such\nwitnesses are often put up by one's opponent and,\nafter promising to say everything that will help our\ncase, give answers of exactly the opposite character\nand carry more weight by the admission of facts\nwhich tell against us than they would have done had\nthey disproved them. We must therefore discover\nwhat motives they have for doing our opponent a hurt,\nand the fact that they were once his enemies will\nnot suffice our purpose we must find out whether\nthey have ceased to be ill-disposed to him or whether\nthey desire by means of their evidence to effect a\nreconciliation with him, in order to assure ourselves that they have not been bribed or repented of their previous attitude and changed their purpose.\nSuch precautions are necessary even with witnesses\nwho know that what they propose to say is true;\nbut it is still more necessary with those who promise\nto give false evidence. For experience shows that\nthey are more likely to repent of their purpose, their\npromises are less to be relied on, and, if they do keep\ntheir promise, their evidence is easier to refute. Witnesses appearing in answer to a subpoena may\nbe divided into two classes those who desire to\nharm the accused, and those who do not. The\naccuser sometimes is aware of their disposition,\nsometimes unaware. For the moment let us assume\nthat he is aware of their disposition, although I must\npoint out that in either case the utmost skill is required in their examination. For if an advocate is\nproducing a witness who is desirous of harming the\naccused, he must avoid letting this desire become\napparent, and must not at once proceed to question\nhim on the point at issue. On the contrary this\npoint must be approached by a circuitous route in\nsuch a manner as to make it seem that the statement which the witness is really desirous of making\nhas been forced from him. Again lie should not\npress the witness too much, for fear he should impair\nhis credit by the glibness with which lie answers\nevery question, but should draw from him just so\nmuch as may seem reasonable to elicit from a single\nwitness. On the other hand in the case of a witness\nwho is reluctant to tell the truth, the essential for\nsuccessful examination is to extort the truth against\nhis will This can only be done by putting questions\nwhich have all the appearance of irrelevance.\nIf this he done, he will give replies which he thinks can do no harm to the party which he\nfavours, and subsequently will be led on from the\nadmissions which he has made to a position which\nrenders it impossible for him to deny the truth of\nthe facts which he is reluctant to state. For just as\nin a set speech we usually collect detached arguments which in themselves seem innocuous to the\naccused, but taken together prove the case against\nhim, so we must ask the reluctant witness a number\nof questions relative to acts antecedent or subsequent\nto the case, places, dates, persons, etcetera, with a\nview to luring him into some reply which will force\nhim to make the admissions which we desire or to\ncontradict his previous evidence. If this fails, we\nmust content ourselves with making it clear that he\nis reluctant to tell what he knows, and lead him\nwith a view to tripping him up on some point or\nother, even though it be irrelevant to the case; we\nmust also keep him in the witness-box for an unusual\nlength of time, so that by saying everything that can\nbe said and more than is necessary on behalf of the\naccused, he may be rendered suspect to the judge.\nThus he will do the accused no less harm than if he\nhad told the truth against him. But if to proceed to\nour second supposition the advocate does not know\nwhat the intentions of the witness may be, he must\nadvance gradually inch by inch and sound him by\nexamination and lead him step by step to the particular reply which it is desired to elicit. But since\nthese witnesses are sometimes so artful that their\nfirst replies are designed to meet the wishes of the\nquestioner, in order to win all the greater credit\nwhen subsequently they answer in a very different\nway, it will be the duty of the advocate to dismiss a suspect witness while he can still do so with\nadvantage. In the case of advocates for the defence examination is in some respects easier, in some more\ndifficult. It is more difficult because it is rarely\npossible for them to have any previous knowledge of\nwhat the witness is likely to say, and easier because,\nwhen they come to cross-examine, they know what\nhe has already said. Consequently in view of the\nuncertainty involved, there is need for careful inquiry with a view to discovering the character of the\nwitness against the accused and what are his motives\nfor hostility and what its extent and all such points\nabout the witness should be set forth in advance\nand disposed of, whether we desire to represent the\nevidence against the accused as instigated by hatred,\nenvy, bribery or influence. Further, if our opponents\nbring forward only a small number of witnesses, we\nmust attack them on that head; if on the other\nhand they produce an excessive number, we must\naccuse them of conspiracy if the witnesses are\npersons of inconspicuous rank, we must minimise\ntheir importance, while if they are powerful, we shall\naccuse our adversaries of bringing undue influence to\nbear. It will, however, be still more helpful if we\nexpose the motives which they have for desiring to\ninjure the accused, and these will vary according to\nthe nature of the case and the parties concerned.\nFor the other lines of argument mentioned above\nare often answered by the employment of commonplaces on similar lines, since the prosecutor, if he\nproduce but few witnesses of inconspicuous rank, can\nparade the simple honesty of his methods on the\nground that he has produced none save those who are in a position to know the real facts, while if he\nproduce a number of distinguished witnesses, it is\neven easier to commend them to the court. But at\ntimes, just as we have to praise individual witnesses,\nso we may have to demolish them, whether their\nevidence has been given in documentary form or they\nhave been summoned to appear in person. This was\neasier and of more frequent occurrence in the days\nwhen the examination of the witnesses was not\ndeferred till after the conclusion of the pleading.\nWith regard to what we should say against individual\nwitnesses, no general rules can be laid down it will\ndepend on the personality of the witness. It remains to consider the technique to be followed\nin the examination of witnesses. The first essential\nis to know your witness. For a timid witness may\nbe terrorised, a fool outwitted, an irascible man\nprovoked, and vanity flattered. The shrewd and\nself-possessed witness, on the other hand, must be\ndismissed at once as being malicious and obstinate;\nor refuted, not by cross-examination, but by a brief\nspeech from the counsel for the defence; or may be\nput out of countenance by some jest, if a favourable\nopportunity presents itself; or, if his past life admits\nof criticism, his credit may be overthrown by the\nscandalous charges which can be brought against him.\nIt has been found advantageous at times when confronted with an honest and respectable witness to\nrefrain from pressing him hard, since it is often the\ncase that those who would have defended themselves\nmanfully against attack are mollified by courtesy.\nBut every question is either concerned with the\ncase itself or with something outside the case. As\nregards the first type of question counsel for the defence may, by adopting a method which I have\nalready recommended for the prosecutor, namely by\ncommencing his examination with questions of an\napparently irrelevant and innocent character and\nthen by comparing previous with subsequent replies,\nfrequently lead witnesses into such a position that\nit becomes possible to extort useful admissions from\nthem against their will. The schools, it is true, give\nno instruction either as to theory or practice in this\nsubject, and skill in examination comes rather\nfrom natural talent or practice. If, however, I am\nasked to point out a model for imitation, I can\nrecommend but one, namely that which may be\nfound in the dialogues of the Socratics and more\nespecially of Plato, in which the questions put are\nso shrewd that although individually as a rule the\nanswers are perfectly satisfactory to the other side,\nyet the questioner reaches the conclusion at which\nhe is aiming. Fortune sometimes is so kind that a\nwitness gives an answer involving some inconsistency,\nwhile at times and this is a more frequent occurrence\none witness contradicts another. But acute examination methodically conducted will generally reach\nthe same result which is so often reached by chance.\nThere are also a number of points strictly irrelevant\nto the case on which questions may be put with\nadvantage. We may for example ask questions about\nthe past life of other witnesses or about the witness'\nown character, with a view to discovering whether\nthey can be charged with some disgraceful conduct,\nor degrading occupation, with friendship with the\nprosecutor or hostility toward the accused, since\nin replying to such questions they may say something which will help our cause or may be convicted of falsehood or of a desire to injure the accused.\nBut above all our examination must be circumspect,\nsince a witness will often launch some smart repartee\nin answering counsel for the defence and thereby\nwin marked favour from the audience in general.\nSecondly, we must put our questions as far as possible\nin the language of everyday speech that the witness,\nwho is often an uneducated man, may understand our\nmeaning, or at any rate may have no opportunity of\nsaying that he does not know what we mean, a\nstatement which is apt to prove highly disconcerting\nto the examiner. I must however express the\nstrongest disapproval of the practice of sending a\nsuborned witness to sit on the benches of the opposing party, in order that on being called into the\nwitness-box from that quarter he may thereby do all\nthe more damage to the case for the accused by\nspeaking against the party with whose adherents he\nwas sitting or, while appearing to help him by his\ntestimony, deliberately giving his evidence in such\nan extravagant and exaggerated manner, as not only\nto detract from the credibility of his own statements, but to annul the advantage derived from\nthe evidence of those who were really helpful. I\nmention this practice not with a view to encourage\nit, but to secure its avoidance. Documentary evidence is not frequently in conflict\nwith oral. Such a circumstance may be turned to\nadvantage by either side. For one party will rest\nits case on the fact that the witness is speaking on\noath, the other on the unanimity of the signatories.\nAgain there is often a conflict between the evidence\nand the arguments. One party will argue that the\nwitnesses know the facts and are bound by the sanctity of their oath, while the arguments are\nnought but ingenious juggling with the facts. The\nother party will argue that witnesses are procured by\ninfluence, fear, money, anger, hatred, friendship, or\nbribery, whereas arguments are drawn from nature;\nin giving his assent to the latter the judge is believing the voice of his own reason, in accepting the\nformer he is giving credence to another. Such\nproblems are common to a number of cases, and are\nand will always be the subject of vehement debate.\nSometimes there are witnesses on both sides and the\nquestion arises with regard to themselves as to which\nare the more respectable in character, or with regard\nto the case, which have given the more credible evidence, with regard to the parties to the case, which\nhas brought the greater influence to bear on the\nwitnesses. If to this kind of evidence anyone should\nwish to add evidence of the sort known as supernatural, based on oracles, prophecies and omens, I\nwould remind him that there are two ways in which\nthese may be treated. There is the general method,\nwith regard to which there is an endless dispute\nbetween the adherents of the Stoics and the Epicureans, as to whether the world is governed by providence. The other is special and is concerned with\nparticular departments of the art of divination, according as they may happen to affect the question at issue.\nFor the credibility of oracles may be established\nor destroyed in one way, and that of soothsayers,\naugurs, diviners and astrologers in another, since\nthe two classes differ entirely in nature. Again the\ntask of establishing or demolishing such evidence as\nthe following will give the orator plenty to do; as\nfor example if certain words have been uttered under the influence of wine, in sleep or in a fit of madness,\nor if information has been picked up from the mouths\nof children, whom the one party will assert to be incapable of invention, while the other will assert that\nthey do not know what they are saying. The following method may not merely be used with great effect,\nbut may even be badly missed when it is not employed. You gave me the money. Who counted it out\nWhere did this occur and from what source did the money\ncome You accuse me of poisoning. Where did I buy\nthe poison and from whom What did I pay for it and\nwhom did I employ to administer it Who was my\naccomplice Practically all these points are discussed\nby Cicero in dealing with the charge of poisoning in\nthe pro Cluentio. This concludes my observations\nupon inartificial proofs. I have stated them as briefly\nas I could. The second class of proofs are wholly the\nwork of art and consist of matters specially adapted\nto produce belief. They are, however, as a rule almost\nentirely neglected or only very lightly touched on\nby those who, avoiding arguments as rugged and\nrepulsive things, confine themselves to pleasanter\nregions and, like those who, as poets tell, were bewitched by tasting a magic herb in the land of the\nLotus-eaters or by the song of the Sirens into preferring pleasure to safety, follow the empty semblance\nof renown and are robbed of that victory which is the\naim of eloquence. And yet those other forms of\neloquence, which have a more continuous sweep and\nflow, are employed with a view to assisting and\nembellishing the arguments and produce the appearance of super inducing a body upon the sinews, on\nwhich the whole case rests; thus if it is asserted that some act has been committed under the influence of anger, fear or desire, we may expatiate\nat some length on the nature of each of these\npassions. It is by these same methods that we\npraise, accuse, exaggerate, attenuate, describe, deter,\ncomplain, console or exhort. But such rhetorical\ndevices may be employed in connexion with matters\nabout which there is no doubt or at least which we\nspeak of as admitted facts. Nor would I deny that\nthere is some advantage to be gained by pleasing\nour audience and a great deal by stirring their\nemotions. Still, all these devices are more effective,\nwhen the judge thanks he has gained a full knowledge\nof the facts of the case, which we can only give him\nby argument and by the employment of every other\nknown means of proof. Before, however, I proceed to classify the various\nspecies of artificial proof, I must point out that there\nare certain features common to all kinds of proof.\nFor there is no question which is not concerned\neither with things or persons, nor can there be any\nground for argument save in connexion with matters\nconcerning things or persons, which may be considered\neither by themselves or with reference to something\nelse; while there can be no proof except such as is\nderived from things consequent or things opposite,\nwhich must be sought for either in the time preceding, contemporaneous with or subsequent to the\nalleged fact, nor can any single thing be proved save\nby reference to something else which must be\ngreater, less than or equal to it. As regards arguments, they may be found either in the questions\nraised by the case, which may be considered by themselves quite apart from any connexion with individual things or persons, or in the case itself, when anything is discovered in it which cannot be arrived at\nby the light of common reason, but is peculiar to the\nsubject on which judgment has to be given. Further,\nall proofs fall into three classes, necessary, credible,\nand not impossible. Again there are four forms of\nproof. First, we may argue that, because one thing\nis, another thing is not; as It is day and therefore not\nnight. Secondly, we may argue that, because one\nthing is, another thing is; as The sun is risen, thereit is day. Thirdly, it may be argued that because one\nthing is not, another thing is; as It is not night, therefore it is day. Finally, it may be argued that, because\none thing is not, another thing is not; as He is not a\nreasoning being, therefore he is not a man. These\ngeneral remarks will suffice by way of introduction\nand I will now proceed to details. I undertook my present task, Marcellus Victorius,\nmainly to gratify your request, but also with a view\nto assist the more earnest of our young men as far\nas lay in my power, while latterly the energy with\nwhich I have devoted myself to my labours has\nbeen inspired by the almost imperative necessity\nimposed by the office conferred on me, though\nall the while I have had an eye to my own\npersonal pleasure. For I thought that this work\nwould be the most precious part of the inheritance\nthat would fall to my son, whose ability was so\nremarkable that it called for the most anxious\ncultivation on the part of his father. Thus if, as\nwould have been but just and devoutly to be\nwished, the fates had torn me from his side, he\nwould still have been able to enjoy the benefit of\nhis father's instruction. Night and day I pursued\nthis design, and strove to hasten its completion in\nthe fear that death might cut me off with my task\nunfinished, when misfortune overwhelmed me with\nsuch suddenness, that the success of my labours now\ninterests no one less than myself. A second bereavement has fallen upon me, and I have lost him of\nwhom I had formed the highest expectations, and\nin whom I reposed all the hopes that should solace\nmy old age. What is there left for me to do Or what further use can I hope to be on earth, when\nheaven thus frowns upon me For it so chances\nthat just at the moment when I began my book on\nthe causes of the decline of eloquence, I was stricken\nby a like affliction. Better had I thrown that illomened work and all my ill-starred learning upon\nthe flames of that untimely pyre that was to consume\nthe darling of my heart, and had not sought to\nburden my unnatural persistence in this wicked\nworld with the fatigue of fresh labours For what\nfather with a spark of proper feeling would pardon\nme for having the heart to pursue my researches\nfurther, and would not hate me for my insensibility,\nhad I other use for my voice than to rail against\nhigh heaven for having suffered me to outlive all\nmy nearest and dearest, and to testify that providence deigns not at all to watch over this earth of\nours If this is not proved by my own misfortune\nand yet my only fault is that I still live, it is most\nsurely manifest in theirs, who were cut off thus\nuntimely; their mother was taken from me earlier\nstill, she had borne me two sons ere the completion of\nher nineteenth year; but for her, though she too died\nmost untimely, death was a blessing. Yet for me her\ndeath alone was such a blow that thereafter no good\nfortune could bring me true happiness. For she had\nevery virtue that is given to woman to possess, and\nleft her husband a prey to irremediable grief; nay,\nso young was she when death took her, that if her\nage be compared with mine, her decease was like\nthe loss not merely of a wife, but of a daughter.\nStill her children survived her, and I, too, lived on\nby some unnatural ordinance of fate, which for all\nits perversity was what she herself desired; and thus by her swift departure from this life she escaped\ntile worst of tortures. My youngest boy was barely\nfive, when he was the first to leave me, robbing me\nas it were of one of my two eyes. I have no desire\nto flaunt my woes in the public gaze, nor to exaggerate the cause I have for tears; would that I had\nsome means to make it less But how can I forget\nthe charm of his face, the sweetness of his speech,\nhis first flashes of promise, and his actual possession\nof a calm and, incredible though it may seem, a\npowerful mind. Such a child would have captivated\nmy affections, even had he been another's. Nor was\nthis all; to enhance my agony the malignity of\ndesigning fortune had willed that he should devote\nall his love to me, preferring me to his nurses, to\nhis grandmother who brought him up, and all those\nwho, as a rule, win the special affection of infancy.\nI am, therefore, grateful to the grief that came to\nme some few months before his loss in the death\nof his mother, the best of women, whose virtues\nwere beyond all praise. For I have less reason to\nweep my own fate than to rejoice at hers. After these calamities all my hopes, all my delight\nwere centred on my little Quintilian, and he might\nhave sufficed to console me. For his gifts were not\nmerely in the bud like those of his brother as\nearly as his ninth birthday he had put forth sure\nand well-formed fruit. By my own sorrows, by the\ntestimony of my own sad heart, by his departed\nspirit, the deity at whose shrine my grief does\nworship, I swear that I discerned in him such talent,\nnot merely in receiving instruction, although in all\nmy wide experience I have never seen his like, nor\nin his power of spontaneous application, to which his teachers can bear witness, but such upright, pious,\nhumane and generous feelings, as alone might have\nsufficed to fill me with the dread of the fearful\nthunder-stroke that has smitten me down for it\nis a matter of common observation that those who\nripen early die young, and that there is some malign\ninfluence that delights in cutting short the greatest\npromise and refusing to permit our joys to pass\nbeyond the bound allotted to mortal man. He\npossessed every incidental advantage as well, a\npleasing and resonant voice, a sweetness of speech,\nand a perfect correctness in pronouncing every letter\nboth in Greek and Latin, as though either were his\nnative tongue. But all these were but the promise\nof greater things. He had finer qualities, courage\nand dignity, and the strength to resist both fear\nand pain. What fortitude he showed during an illness of eight months, till all his physicians marvelled\nat him How he consoled me during his last\nmoments. How even in the wanderings of delirium\ndid his thoughts recur to his lessons and his literary\nstudies, even when his strength was sinking and he\nwas no longer ours to claim Child of my vain\nhopes, did I see your eyes fading in death and your\nbreath take its last flight Had I the heart to\nreceive your fleeting spirit, as I embraced your cold\npale body, and to live on breathing the common air.\nJustly do I endure the agony that now is mine, and\nthe thoughts that torment me. Have I lost you at\nthe moment when adoption by a consular had given\nhope that you would rise to all the high offices of\nstate, when you were destined to be the son-in-law\nof your uncle the praetor, and gave promise of\nrivalling the eloquence of your grandsire and do I your father survive only to weep May my endurance not my will to live, for that is gone from me\nprove me worthy of you through all my remaining\nyears. For it is in vain that we impute all our ills\nto fortune. No man grieves long save through his\nown fault. But I still live, and must find something\nto make life tolerable, and must needs put faith in\nthe verdict of the wise, who held that literature\nalone can provide true solace in adversity. Yet, if\never the violence of my present grief subside and\nadmit the intrusion of some other thought on so\nmany sorrowful reflexions, I may with good cause\nask pardon for the delay in bringing my work to\ncompletion. Who can wonder that my studies have\nbeen interrupted, when the real marvel is that they\nhave not been broken off altogether Should\ncertain portions therefore betray a lack of finish\ncompared with what was begun in the days when\nmy affliction was less profound, I would ask that the\nimperfections should be regarded with indulgence,\nas being due to the cruel tyranny of fortune, which,\nif it has not utterly extinguished, has at any rate\nweakened such poor powers of intellect as I once\npossessed. But for this very reason I must rouse\nmyself to face my task with greater spirit, since it\nis easy to despise fortune, though it may be hard\nto bear her blows. For there is nothing left that\nshe can do to me, since out of my calamities she\nhas wrought for me a security which, full of sorrow\nthough it be, is such that nothing can shake it.\nAnd the very fact that I have no personal interest\nin persevering with my present work, but am moved\nsolely by the desire to serve others, if indeed anything that I write can be of such service, is a reason for regarding my labours with an indulgent eye.\nAlas I shall bequeath it, like my patrimony, for\nothers than those to whom it was my design to\nleave it. The next subject which I was going to discuss\nwas the peroration which some call the completion\nand others the conclusion. There are two kinds of\nperoration, for it may deal either with facts or with\nthe emotional aspect of the case. The repetition\nand grouping of the facts, which the Greeks call and some of our own writers call the\nenumeration, serves both to refresh the memory of\nthe judge and to place the whole of the case before\nhis eyes, and, even although the facts may have\nmade little impression on him in detail, their cumulative effect is considerable. This final recapitulation must be as brief as possible and, as the\nGreek term indicates, we must summarise the facts\nunder the appropriate heads. For if we devote\ntoo much time thereto, the peroration will cease\nto be an enumeration and will constitute something very like a second speech. On the other\nhand the points selected for enumeration must\nbe treated with weight and dignity, enlivened\nby apt reflexions and diversified by suitable figures;\nfor there is nothing more tiresome than a dry repetition of facts, which merely suggests a lack of\nconfidence in the judges' memory. There are however innumerable ways in which this may be done.\nThe finest example is provided by Cicero's prosecution of Verres. Then follows the enumeration. Another admirable example may be found\nin the same speech where the enumeration of the\ntemples which the praetor had despoiled takes the\nform of invoking the various deities concerned. We\nmay also at times pretend to be in doubt whether\nwe have not omitted something and to wonder what\nthe accused will say in reply to certain points or\nwhat hope tile accuser can have after the manner in\nwhich we have refuted all the charges brought against\nus. But the most attractive form of peroration is\nthat which we may use when we have an opportunity of drawing some argument from our opponent's\nspeech, as for instance when we say or or But I must refrain from dealing with the various methods individually, for fear\nthat the instances that I produce should be regarded\nas exhaustive, whereas our opportunities spring from\nthe nature of the particular case, from the statements\nof our opponents and also from fortuitous circumstances. Nor must we restrict ourselves to recapitulating the points of our own speech, but must call\nupon our opponent to reply to certain questions.\nThis however is only possible if there is time for him\nto do so and if the arguments which we have put\nforward are such as not to admit of refutation. For\nto challenge points which tell in our opponent's\nfavour is not to argue against him, but to play the\npart of prompter to him. The majority of Athenians\nand almost all philosophers who have left anything\nin writing on the art of oratory have held that the\nrecapitulation is the sole form of peroration. I imagine that the reason why the Athenians did so\nwas that appeals to the emotions were forbidden to\nAthenian orators, a proclamation to this effect being\nactually made by the court-usher. I am less surprised at the philosophers taking this view, for they\nregard susceptibility to emotion as a vice, and think\nit immoral that the judge should be distracted from\nthe truth by an appeal to his emotions and that\nit is unbecoming for a good man to make use of\nvicious procedure to serve his ends. None the less\nthey must admit that appeals to emotion are necessary if there are no other means for securing the\nvictory of truth, justice and the public interest. It\nis however admitted by all that recapitulation may\nbe profitably employed in other portions of the\nspeech as well, if the case is complicated and a\nnumber of different arguments have been employed\nin the defence; though no one will doubt but that\nthere are many cases, in which no recapitulation at\nall is necessary at any point, assuming, that is, that\nthe cases are both brief and simple. This part of\nthe peroration is common both to the prosecution\nand the defence. Both parties as a general rule may likewise employ the appeal to the emotions, but they will\nappeal to different emotions and the defender will\nemploy such appeals with greater frequency and\nfulness. For the accuser has to rouse the judge,\nwhile the defender has to soften him. Still even\nthe accuser will sometimes make his audience weep\nby the pity excited for the man whose wrongs he\nseeks to avenge, while the defendant will at times\ndevelop no small vehemence when he complains of\nthe injustice of the calumny or conspiracy of which he is the victim. It will therefore be best to treat\nthese duties separately as I have already said, they\nare much the same in the peroration as in the\nexordium, but are freer and wider in scope in the\nformer. For our attempts to sway the judges are\nmade more sparingly at the commencement of the\nspeech, when it is enough that such an attempt\nshould gain admittance and we have the whole\nspeech before us. On the other hand in the peroration we have to consider what the feelings of the\njudge will be when he retires to consider his verdict,\nfor we shall have no further opportunity to say anything and cannot any longer reserve arguments to be\nproduced later. It is therefore the duty of both parties\nto seek to win the judge's goodwill and to divert it\nfrom their opponent, as also to excite or assuage his\nemotions. And the following brief rule may be laid\ndown for the observation of both parties, that the\norator should display the full strength of his case\nbefore the eyes of the judge, and, when he has made\nup his mind what points in his case actually deserve\nor may seem to deserve to excite envy, goodwill,\ndislike or pity, should dwell on those points by which\nhe himself would be most moved were he trying the\ncase. But it will be safer to discuss these considerations in detail. The points likely to commend the accuser to the\njudge have already been stated in my remarks on\nthe exordium. There are however certain things\nwhich require fuller treatment in the peroration\nthan in the exordium, where it is sufficient merely to\noutline them. This fuller treatment is specially\nrequired if the accused be a man of violent, unpopular or dangerous character or if the condemnation of the accused is likely to cover the judges with\nglory or his acquittal with disgrace. Calvus for\nexample in his speech against Vatinius makes an\nadmirable remark Cicero again in the Verrines\nsays that the ill-name acquired by the courts may\nbe effaced by the condemnation of Verres, a statement that comes under the head of the conciliatory\nmethods mentioned above. The appeal to tear also,\nif it is necessary to employ it to produce a like effect,\noccupies a more prominent place in the peroration\nthan in the exordium, but I have expressed my views\non this subject in an earlier book. The peroration\nalso provides freer opportunities for exciting the\npassions of jealousy, hatred or anger. As regards the\ncircumstances likely to excite such feelings in the\njudge, jealousy will be produced by the influence of\nthe accused, hatred by the disgraceful nature of his\nconduct, and anger by his disrespectful attitude to\nthe court, if, for instance, he be contumacious,\narrogant or studiously indifferent such anger may be\naroused not merely by specific acts or words, but by\nhis looks, bearing and manner. In this connexion\nthe remark made by the accuser of Cossutianus\nCapito in my young days was regarded with great\napproval the words used were Greek, but may be\ntranslated thus\nThe best way however for the accuser to excite the\nfeelings of the judge is to make the charge which he\nbrings against the accused seem as atrocious or, if\nfeasible, as deplorable as possible. Its atrocity may\nbe enhanced by considerations of the nature of\nthe act, the position of its author or the victim, the purpose, time, place and manner of the act all of\nwhich may be treated with infinite variety. Suppose\nthat we are complaining that our client has been\nbeaten. We must first speak of the act itself; we\nshall then proceed to point out that the victim was\nan old man, a child, a magistrate, an honest man or\na benefactor to the state; we shall also point out\nthat the assailant was a worthless and contemptible\nfellow, or to take the opposite case was in a\nposition of excessive power or was the last man who\nshould have given the blow, or again that the\noccasion was a solemn festival, or that the act was\ncommitted at a time when such crimes were\npunished with special severity by the courts or when\npublic order was at a dangerously low ebb. Again\nthe hatred excited by the act will be enhanced if it\nwas committed in the theatre, in a temple, or at\na public assembly, and if the blow was given not\nin mistake or in a moment of passion or, if it\nwas the result of passion which was quite unjustifiable, being due to the fact that the victim\nhad gone to the assistance of his father or had\nmade some reply or was a candidate for the same\noffice as his assailant; or finally we may hint that\nhe wished to inflict more serious injury than he\nsucceeded in inflicting. But it is the manner of the\nact that contributes most to the impression of its\natrocity, if, for example, the blow was violent or insulting thus Demosthenes seeks to excite hatred\nagainst Midias by emphasising the position of the\nblow, the attitude of the assailant and the expression\nof his face. It is in this connexion that we shall\nhave to consider whether a man was killed by sword\nor fire or poison, by one wound or several, and whether he was slain on the spot or tortured by\nbeing kept in suspense. The accuser will also\nfrequently attempt to excite pity by complaining of\nthe fate of the man whom he is seeking to avenge or\nof the desolation which has fallen upon his children\nor parents. The judges may also be moved by drawing a picture of the future, of the fate which awaits\nthose who have complained of violence and wrong,\nif they fail to secure justice. They must go into exile,\ngive up their property or endure to the end whatever their enemy may choose to inflict upon them.\nBut it will more frequently be the duty of the\naccuser to divert the judge from all the temptations\nto pity which the accused will place before him, and\nto incite him to give a strong and dispassionate\nverdict. It will also be his duty in this connexion\nto forestall the arguments and actions to which his\nopponent seems likely to have recourse. For it\nmakes the judge more cautious in observing the\nsanctity of his oath and destroys the influence of\nthose who are going to reply to us when the arguments used by the defence have already been dealt\nwith by the prosecution, since they lose their novelty.\nAn instance of this will be found in the speech of\nMessala against Aufidia, where he warns Servius\nSulpicius not to talk about the peril which\nthreatens the signatories to the document and the\ndefendant herself. Again Aesehines foretells the\nline of defence which Demosthenes will pursue.\nThere are also occasions when the judges should be\ntold what answer they should make to requests on\nbehalf of the accused, a proceeding which is a form\nof recapitulation. If we turn to the defendant, we must note that his worth, nis manly pursuits, the scars from wounds\nreceived in battle, his rank and the services rendered\nby his ancestors, will all commend him to the goodwill of the judges. Cicero, as I have already pointed\nout, and Asinius both make use of this form of\nappeal indeed they may almost be regarded as\nrivals in this respect, since Cicero employed it when\ndefending the elder Scaurus, Asinius when defending the son. Again, the cause which has brought\nthe accused into peril may serve to produce the\nsame effect, if, for example, it appears that he has\nincurred enmity on account of some honourable\naction above all his goodness, humanity or pity\nmay be emphasised with this end in view. For it\nadds to the apparent justice of his claim, if all that\nhe asks of the judge is that he should grant to him\nwhat he himself has granted to others. We may\nalso in this connexion lay stress on the interests of\nthe state, the glory which will accrue to the judges,\nthe importance of the precedent which their verdict\nwill set and the place it will hold in the memory of\nafter generations. But the appeal which will carry\nmost weight is the appeal to pity, which not merely\nforces the judge to change his views, but even to\nbetray his emotion by tears. Such appeals to pity\nwill be based either on the previous or present\nsufferings of the accused, or on those which await\nhim if condemned. And the force of our appeal will\nbe doubled if we contrast the fortune which he now\nenjoys with that to which he will be reduced, if he\nfail. In this connexion great play may be made by\nreference to the age and sex of the accused, or to\nhis nearest and dearest, that is, his children, parents\nand kindred, all of which topics are treated in different ways. Sometimes the advocate himself may\neven assume the role of close intimacy with his\nclient, as Cicero does in the pro Milone, where he\ncries Such a method is\nespecially serviceable when, as was the case with\nMilo, entreaty is not in keeping with the character\nof the accused. Who would have endured to hear\nMilo pleading for his life, when he admitted that\nhe had killed a man of noble birth because it was\nhis duty to do so Consequently Cicero sought to\nwin the judges' goodwill for Milo by emphasising\nthe staunchness of his character, and himself assumed\nthe role of suppliant. Impersonation may also be employed with profit\nin such passages, and by impersonations I mean\nfictitious speeches supposed to be uttered, such as\nan advocate puts into the mouth of his client. The\nbare facts are no doubt moving in themselves; but\nwhen we pretend that the persons concerned themselves are speaking, the personal note adds to the\nemotional effect. For then the judge seems no\nlonger to be listening to a voice bewailing another's\nills, but to hear the voice and feelings of the unhappy\nvictims, men whose appearance alone would call\nforth his tears even though they uttered never a\nword. And as their plea would awaken yet greater\npity if they urged it with their own lips, so it is\nrendered to some extent all the more effective when\nit is, as it were, put into their mouth by their\nadvocate we may draw a parallel from the stage, where the actor's voice and delivery produce greater\nemotional effect when he is speaking in an assumed\nrole than when he speaks in his own character.\nConsequently Cicero, to quote him once again,\nalthough he will not put entreaties into Milo's\nmouth, and prefers to commend him by his staunchness of character, still lends him words in the form\nof such complaint as may become a brave man. he says, Appeals to pity should, however, always be brief,\nand there is good reason for the saying that nothing\ndries so quickly as tears. Time assuages even\ngenuine grief, and it is therefore inevitable that the\nsemblance of grief portrayed in our speech should\nvanish yet more rapidly. And if we spend too much\ntime over such portrayal our hearer grows weary of\nhis tears, takes a breathing space, and returns once\nmore to the rational attitude from which lie has\nbeen distracted by the impulse of the moment. We\nmust not, therefore, allow the effect which we have\nproduced to fall flat, and must consequently abandon\nour appeal to the emotion just when that emotion\nis at its height, nor must we expect anyone to\nweep for long over another's ills. For this reason\nour eloquence ought to be pitched higher in this\nportion of our speech than in any other, since,\nwherever it fails to add something to what has preceded, it seems even to diminish its previous effect,\nwhile a diminuendo is merely a step towards the\nrapid disappearance of the emotion. Actions as well as words may be employed to\nmove the court to tears. Hence the custom of bringing accused persons into court wearing squalid\nand unkempt attire, and of introducing their children\nand parents, and it is with this in view that we see\nblood-stained swords, fragments of bone taken from\nthe wound, and garments spotted with blood, displayed by the accusers, wounds stripped of their\ndressings, and scourged bodies bared to view. The\nimpression produced by such exhibitions is generally\nenormous, since they seem to bring the spectators\nface to face with the cruel facts. For example, the\nsight of the bloodstains on the purple-bordered toga\nof Gaius Caesar, which was carried at the head of\nhis funeral procession, aroused the Roman people to\nfury. They knew that he had been killed; they\nhad even seen his body stretched upon the bier\nbut his garment, still wet with his blood, brought\nsuch a vivid image of the crime before their minds,\nthat Caesar seemed not to have been murdered, but\nto be being murdered before their very eyes. Still I\nwould not for this reason go so far as to approve a\npractice of which I have read, and which indeed I\nhave occasionally witnessed, of bringing into court\na picture of the crime painted on wood or canvas,\nthat the judge might be stirred to fury by the\nhorror of the sight. For the pleader who prefers\na voiceless picture to speak for him in place of his\nown eloquence must be singularly incompetent. On\nthe other hand, I know that the wearing of mourning and the presentation of an unkempt appearance,\nand the introduction of relatives similarly arrayed,\nhas proved of value, and that entreaties have been\nof great service to save the accused from condemnation. The practice therefore of appealing to the\njudges by all that is near and dear to them will be of great service to the accused, especially if he, too,\nhas children, a wife and parents. Invocation of the\ngods, again, usually gives the impression that the\nspeaker is conscious of the justice of his cause, while\nit may produce a good effect if the accused throws\nhimself on the ground and embraces the knees of\nthe judges, unless his character, his past life and\nstation prohibit a resort to this device for there are\nsome acts which require to be defended with no less\nboldness than was required for their commission. But\nwe must take care not to carry matters with too\nhigh a hand, for fear of creating a bad impression\nby an appearance of over-confidence. The most\neffective of all such methods was in times past that\nby which more than anything else Cicero is considered to have saved Lucius Murena from the\nattacks of his accusers, who were men of the greatest\ndistinction. For he persuaded the court that nothing\nwas more necessary in view of the critical position\nof affairs than that Murena should assume the consulship on the thirty-first of December. This form of\nappeal is now, however, almost entirely obsolete,\nsince the safety of the state is to-day dependent on\nthe watchful care of a single ruler, and cannot conceivably be imperilled by the result of a trial. I have spoken of accusers and accused because it\nis in situations involving danger that the emotional\nappeal is most serviceable. But private cases also\nadmit of both kinds of peroration, namely, that which\nconsists in the recapitulation of the proofs and that\nwhich takes the form of an appeal for pity, the\nlatter being employed when the position or reputation of the litigant seems to be in danger. For to embark on such tragic methods in trivial cases would\nbe like putting the mask and buskins of Hercules\non a small child. It is also worth while pointing out that, in my\nopinion, the manner in which the client whose\nsorrows we parade before the court conforms his\nbehaviour to the methods of his advocate is of the\nutmost importance. For sometimes our appeal falls\nflat owing to the ignorance, rusticity, indifference or\nuncouthness of our client, and it is consequently\nmost important that the advocate should take all\nnecessary precautions in this connexion. I have\noften seen clients whose behaviour was wholly out\nof keeping with the line adopted by their counsel,\nsince their expression showed not the slightest\nemotion, while they displayed a most unseasonable\ncheerfulness and even aroused laughter by their\nlooks or actions; such incongruity is especially frequent when the appeal is of a theatrical character.\nOn one occasion an advocate produced a girl alleged\nto be the sister of the opposing party for it was on\nthis point that the dispute turned and led her\nacross to the benches occupied by his opponents as\nthough to leave her in the arms of her brother I however had given tile brother timely warning and he had\nleft his seat. The advocate, although as a rule an\neloquent speaker, was struck dumb by the unexpected\nturn of events and took his little girl back again in\nthe tamest possible manner. There was another\nadvocate who was defending a woman who thought\nto secure a great effect by producing the portrait of\nher husband, but sent the court into repeated\npeals of laughter. For the persons entrusted with\nthe duty of handing in the portrait had no idea of the nature of a peroration and displayed it whenever the advocate looked their way, and when at last\nit was produced at the proper moment it destroyed\nall the good effect of his previous eloquence by its\nhideousness, for it was a wax cast taken from an old\nman's corpse. We are also familiar with the story\nof what happened to Glycon, nicknamed Spiridion.\nHe asked a boy whom he produced in court why he\nwas crying; to which the boy replied, that his\npaedagogus was pinching him. But the most effective\nwarning as to the perils which beset the peroration\nis the story told by Cicero about the Caepasii.\nBut all these perils may be boldly faced by those\nwho have no difficulty in changing their line of\npleading. Those however who cannot get away\nfrom what they have written, are reduced to silence\nby such emergencies or else led into making false\nstatements, as for instance if an advocate should say, or or although the person in question is doing\nnone of these things. Such faults are due to the\npractice of the schools, where we are free to feign\nwhat we will with impunity, because we are at\nliberty to invent facts. But this is impossible when\nwe are confronted with realities, and it was an\nexcellent remark that Cassius made to a young\norator who said, To which he replied, And he fixed his eyes on him with\nthe most ferocious scowl that he could muster.\nThere is one point which it is specially important to remember, that we should never attempt to move our\naudience to tears without drawing on all the resources\nof our eloquence. For while this form of emotional\nappeal is the most effective of all, when successful,\nits failure results in anti-climax, and if the pleader is\na feeble speaker he would have been wiser to leave\nthe pathos of the situation to the imagination of the\njudges. For look and voice and even the expression\non the face of the accused to which the attention of\nthe court is drawn will generally awaken laughter\nwhere they fail to awaken compassion. Therefore\nthe pleader must measure and make a careful\nestimate of his powers, and must have a just comprehension of the difficulty of the task which he\ncontemplates. For there is no halfway house in such\nmatters between tears and laughter. The task of the peroration is not however confined\nto exciting pity in the judges it may also be required to dispel the pity which they feel, either by\na set speech designed to recall them from their tears\nto a consideration of the justice of the case, or by a\nfew witticisms such as, or the remark made by counsel\nto a corpulent client, whose opponent, a mere child,\nhad been carried round the court by his advocate, Such\njests should not however descend to buffoonery.\nConsequently I cannot give my approval to the\norator, although he was one of the most distinguished speakers of his day, who, when his opponent\nbrought in some children to enhance the effect of\nhis peroration, threw some dice among them, with\nthe result that they began to scramble for them.\nFor their childish ignorance of the perils with which they were threatened might in itself have awakened\ncompassion. For the same reason I cannot commend\nthe advocate who, when his opponent the accuser\nproduced a bloodstained sword in court, fled suddenly\nfrom the benches as though in an agony of terror,\nand then, when his turn came to plead, peeped out\nof the crowd with his head half covered by his robe\nand asked whether the man with the sword had\ngone away. For though he caused a laugh, he made\nhimself ridiculous. Still, theatrical effects of the\nkind we are discussing can be dispelled by the\npower of eloquence. Cicero provides most admirable\nexamples of the way in which this may be done both\nin the pro Rabirio where he attacks the production\nin court of the portrait of Saturninus in the most\ndignified language, and in the pro Vareno where he\nlaunches a number of witticisms against a youth\nwhose wound had been unbound at intervals in the\ncourse of the trial. There are also milder kinds of peroration in which,\nif our opponent is of such a character that he deserves to be treated with respect, we strive to\ningratiate ourselves with him or give him some\nfriendly warning or urge him to regard us as his\nfriends. This method was admirably employed by\nPassienus when he pleaded in a suit brought by his\nwife Domitia against her brother Ahenobarbus for\nthe recovery of a sum of money he began by\nmaking a number of remarks about the relationship\nof the two parties and then, referring to their\nwealth, which was in both cases enormous, added, All these appeals to emotion, although some hold that they should be confined to the exordium and\nthe peroration, which are, I admit, the places where\nthey are most often used, may be employed in other\nportions of the speech as well, but more briefly, since\nmost of them must be reserved for the opening or\nthe close. But it is in tile peroration, if anywhere,\nthat we must let loose the whole torrent of our\neloquence. For, if we have spoken well in the rest\nof our speech, we shall now have the judges on our\nside, and shall be in a position, now that we have\nemerged from the reefs and shoals, to spread all our\ncanvas, while since the chief task of the peroration\nconsists of amplification, we may legitimately make\nfree use of words and reflexions that are magnificent\nand ornate. It is at the close of our drama that we\nmust really stir the theatre, when we have reached\nthe place for the phrase with which the old tragedies\nand comedies used to end, In other portions of the speech we must appeal\nto the emotions as occasion may arise. For it would\nclearly be wrong to set forth facts calling for horror\nand pity without any such appeal, while, if the\nquestion arises as to the quality of any fact, such\nan appeal may justifiably be subjoined to the proofs\nof the fact in question. When we are pleading a\ncomplicated case which is really made up of several\ncases, it will be necessary to introduce a number of\npassages resembling perorations, as Cicero does in\nthe Vetrines, where he laments over Philodamus, the\nships' captains, the crucifixion of the Roman citizen,\nand a number of other tragic incidents. Some call\nthese by which they mean a peroration distributed among different portions of a speech. I should regard them rather as species than as parts\nof the peroration, since the terms epilogue and\nperoration both clearly indicate that they form the\nconclusion of a speech. II. The peroration is the most important part of\nforensic pleading, and in the main consists of appeals\nto the emotions, concerning which I have consequently been forced to say something. But I\nhave not yet been able to give the topic specific\nconsideration as a whole, nor should I have been\njustified in doing so. We have still, therefore,\nto discuss a task which forms tile most powerful\nmeans of obtaining what we desire, and is also\nmore difficult than any of those which we have\npreviously considered, namely that of stirring the\nemotions of the judges, and of moulding and\ntransforming them to the attitude which we\ndesire. The few remarks which I have already\nmade on this subject were only such as were\nessential to my theme, while my purpose was rather\nto show what ought to be done than to set forth the\nmanner in which we can secure our aim. I must\nnow review the whole subject in a more exhaustive\nfashion. There is scope for an appeal to the emotions, as\nI have already said,1 in every portion of a speech.\nMoreover these emotions present great variety, and\ndemand more than cursory treatment, since it is in\ntheir handling that the power of oratory shews itself\nat its highest. Even a slight and limited talent may,\nwith the assistance of practice or learning, perhaps\nsucceed in giving life to other departments of oratory,\nand in developing them to a serviceable extent. At\nany rate there are, and have always been, a considerable number of pleaders capable of discovering\narguments adequate to prove their points. I am far\nfrom despising such, but I consider that their utility\nis restricted to providing the judge with such facts\nas it is necessary for him to know, and, to be quite\nfrank, I regard them merely as suitable persons to\ninstruct pleaders of real eloquence in the facts of\na case. But few indeed are those orators who can\nsweep the judge with them, lead him to adopt\nthat attitude of mind which they desire, and compel\nhim to weep with them or share their anger. And\nyet it is this emotional power that dominates\nthe court, it is this form of eloquence that is the\nqueen of all. For as a rule arguments arise out of\nthe case itself, and the better cause has always the\nlarger number to support it, so that the party who\nwills by means of them will have no further satisfaction than that of knowing that his advocate did not\nfail him. But the peculiar task of the orator arises\nwhen the minds of the judges require force to move\nthem, and their thoughts have actually to be led away\nfrom the contemplation of the truth. No instruction\nfrom the litigant can secure this, nor can such power\nbe acquired merely by the study of a brief. Proofs, it\nis true, may induce the judges to regard our case\nas superior to that of our opponent, but the appeal\nto the emotions will do more, for it will make them\nwish our case to be the better. And what they\nwish, they will also believe. For as soon as they\nbegin to be angry, to feel favourably disposed, to\nhate or pity, they begin to take a personal interest\nin the case, and just as lovers are incapable of\nforming a reasoned judgment on the beauty of the\nobject of their affections, because passion forestalls the sense of sight, so the judge, when overcome by\nhis emotions, abandons all attempt to enquire into\nthe truth of the arguments, is swept along by the\ntide of passion, and yields himself unquestioning to\nthe torrent. Thus the verdict of the court shows\nhow much weight has been carried by the arguments\nand the evidence; but when the judge has been\nreally moved by the orator he reveals his feelings\nwhile he is still sitting and listening to the case.\nWhen those tears, which are the aim of most perorations, well forth from his eyes, is he not giving his\nverdict for all to see It is to this, therefore, that\nthe orator must devote all his powers, Without this all else is bare and meagre, weak and\ndevoid of charm. For it is in its power over the\nemotions that the life and soul of oratory is to be\nfound. Emotions however, as we learn from ancient\nauthorities, fall into two classes; the one is called\npathos by the Greeks and is rightly and correctly expressed in Latin by adfectus emotion the other is\ncalled ethos, a word for which in my opinion Latin has\nno equivalent it is however rendered by mores morals\nand consequently the branch of philosophy known as\nethics is styled moral philosophy by us. But close\nconsideration of the nature of the subject leads me\nto think that in this connexion it is not so much\nmorals in general that is meant as certain peculiar\naspects; for the term morals includes every attitude\nof the mind. The more cautious writers have preferred to give the sense of the term rather than to\ntranslate it into Latin. They therefore explain pathos as describing the more violent emotions and ethos as\ndesignating those which are calm and gentle in the\none case the passions are violent, in the other subdued, the former command and disturb, the latter\npersuade and induce a feeling of goodwill. Some\nadd that ethos is continuous, while pathos is momentary. While admitting that this is usually the ease,\nI still hold that there are some subjects which\ndemand that the more violent emotion should be\ncontinuous. But, although the gentler emotions\nrequire less force and impetus, they call for no less\nart and experience than the more vehement, and are\ndemanded in a greater number of cases, indeed in a\ncertain sense they are required in all. For as everything treated by the orator may be regarded from\nthe ethical standpoint, we may apply the word ethos\nwhenever he speaks of what is honourable and expedient or of what ought or ought not to be done.\nSome regard commendation and excuse as the peculiar spheres of ethos, but while I admit that they do\nfall within its sphere, I do not regard them as being\nalone in so doing. Indeed I would add that pathos\nand ethos are sometimes of the same nature, differing\nonly in degree; love for instance comes under the\nhead of pathos, affection of ethos; sometimes however\nthey differ, a distinction which is important for the\nperoration, since ethos is generally employed to calm\nthe storm aroused by pathos. I ought however to\nexplain what is meant by ethos in greater detail,\nsince the term is not in itself sufficiently expressive\nof its meaning. The ethos which I have in my mind\nand which I desiderate in an orator is commended\nto our approval by goodness more than aught else\nand is not merely calm and mild, but in most cases ingratiating and courteous and such as to excite\npleasure and affection in our hearers, while the chief\nmerit in its expression lies in making it seem that\nall that we say derives directly from the nature of\nthe facts and persons concerned and in the revelation of the character of the orator in such a way that\nall may recognise it. This kind of ethos should be\nespecially displayed in cases where the persons concerned are intimately connected, whenever we\ntolerate or pardon any act or offer satisfaction or\nadmonition, in all of which cases there should be no\ntrace of anger or hatred. On the other hand the\nmoderation shown by a father to his son, a guardian\nto his ward or a husband to his wife will differ from\nthat which is shown by an old man to a youthful\nstranger who has insulted him or by a man of high\nrank to his inferior, since in the former cases they\nemphasise their affection for the wrongdoer and\nthere is no desire to do anything that will excite\ndislike against them save by the manifestation of\nthe fact that they still love them; while in the one\ncase the offended party should be no more than provoked, in the other he should he really deeply moved.\nOf the same character, though less violent, is the\nemotion to be shown when we ask pardon for the\nerrors of the young, or apologise for some youthful\namour. Sometimes again gentle raillery of another's\npassion may derive its tone from ethos, though only\nto a partial extent. More closely dependent on ethos\nare the skilful exercise of feigned emotion or the\nemployment of irony in making apologies or asking\nquestions, irony being the term which is applied to\nwords which mean something other than they seem\nto express. From the same source springs also that more powerful method of exciting hatred, when by\na feigned submission to our opponents we pass silent\ncensure on their violence. For the very fact of our\nyielding serves to demonstrate their insupportable\narrogance, while orators who have a passion for abuse\nor are given to affect freedom of speech fail to realise\nthat it is a far more effective course to make your\nantagonist unpopular than to abuse him. For the\nformer course makes our antagonists disliked, the\nlatter ourselves. The emotion of love and longing\nfor our friends and connexions is perhaps of an intermediate character, being stronger than ethos and\nweaker than pathos. There is also good reason for\ngiving the name of ethos to those scholastic exercises\nin which we portray rustics, misers, cowards and\nsuperstitious persons according as our theme may\nrequire. For if ethos denotes moral character, our\nspeech must necessarily be based on ethos when it is\nengaged in portraying such character. Finally ethos in all its forms requires the speaker to\nbe a man of good character and courtesy. For it is\nmost important that he should himself possess or be\nthought to possess those virtues for the possession of\nwhich it is his duty, if possible, to commend his client\nas well, while the excellence of his own character\nwill make his pleading all the more convincing and\nwill be of the utmost service to the cases which he\nundertakes. For the orator who gives the impression of being a bad man while he is speaking, is\nactually speaking badly, since his words seem to be\ninsincere owing to the absence of ethos which would\notherwise have revealed itself. Consequently the\nstyle of oratory employed in such cases should be\ncalm and mild with no trace of pride, elevation or sublimity, all of which would be out of place. It is\nenough to speak appropriately, pleasantly and persuasively, and therefore the intermediate style of\noratory is most suitable. The pathos of the Greeks, which we correctly\ntranslate by emotion, is of a different character, and\nI cannot better indicate the nature of the difference\nthan by saying that ethos rather resembles comedy\nand pathos tragedy. For pathos is almost entirely\nconcerned with anger, dislike, fear, hatred and pity.\nIt will be obvious to all what topics are appropriate\nto such appeals and I have already spoken on the\nsubject in discussing the exordium and the peroration. I wish however to point out that fear is of\ntwo kinds, that which we feel and that which we\ncause in others. Similarly there are two kinds of\ninvidia hatred, envy, to which the two adjectives\ninvidus envious and invidious invidious, hateful\ncorrespond. The first supplies an epithet for persons,\nthe second for things, and it is in this latter connexion that the orator's task is even more onerous.\nFor though some things are hateful in themselves\nsuch as parricide, murder, poisoning, other things\nhave to be made to seem hateful. This latter contingency arises when we attempt to shew that what\nwe have suffered is of a more horrible nature than\nwhat are usually regarded as great evils. Vergil will\nprovide an example in the lines For how wretched was the lot of Andromache, if\nPolyxena be accounted happy in comparison with her Again the same problem arises when we endeavour to magnify our wrongs by saying that other\nfar lesser ills are intolerable; e.g. However I will deal with this subject more fully\nwhen I come to speak of amplification. Meanwhile\nI will content myself with the observation that the\naim of appeals to the emotion is not merely to slew\nthe bitter and grievous nature of ills that actually\nare so, but also to make ills which are usually regarded as tolerable seem unendurable, as for instance\nwhen we represent insulting words as inflicting more\ngrievous injury than an actual blow or represent\ndisgrace as being worse than death. For the force\nof eloquence is such that it not merely compels the\njudge to the conclusion toward which the nature of\nthe facts lead him, but awakens emotions which\neither do not naturally arise from the case or are\nstronger than the case would suggest. This is known\nas deriosis, that is to say, language giving additional\nforce to things unjust, cruel or hateful, an accomplishment in which Demosthenes created immense\nand special effect. If I thought it sufficient to follow traditional rules,\nI should regard it as adequate treatment for this\ntopic to omit nothing that I have read or been\ntaught, provided that it be reasonably sound. But\nmy design is to bring to light the secret principles\nof this art, and to open up the inmost recesses of\nthe subject, giving the result not of teaching received from others, but of my own experience and\nthe guidance of nature herself. The prime essential\nfor stirring the emotions of others is, in my opinion, first to feel those emotions oneself. It is sometimes\npositively ridiculous to counterfeit grief, anger and\nindignation, if we content ourselves with accommodating our words and looks and make no attempt\nto adapt our own feelings to the emotions to be\nexpressed. What other reason is there for the\neloquence with which mourners express their grief;\nor for the fluency which anger lends even to the\nuneducated, save the fact that their minds are\nstirred to power by the depth and sincerity of their\nfeelings Consequently, if we wish to give our\nwords the appearance of sincerity, we must assimilate\nourselves to the emotions of those who are genuinely\nso affected, and our eloquence must spring from the\nsame feeling that we desire to produce in the mind\nof the judge. Will he grieve who can find no trace\nof grief in the words with which I seek to move\nhim to grief Will he be angry, if the orator who\nseeks to kindle his anger shows no sign of labouring\nunder the emotion which he demands from his\naudience Will he shed tears if the pleader's eyes\nare dry It is utterly impossible. Fire alone can\nkindle, and moisture alone can wet, nor can one\nthing impart any colour to another save that which\nit possesses itself. Accordingly, the first essential\nis that those feelings should prevail with us that\nwe wish to prevail with the judge, and that we\nshould be moved ourselves before we attempt to\nmove others. But how are we to generate these\nemotions in ourselves, since emotion is not in our\nown power I will try to explain as best I may. There\nare certain experiences which the Greeks call and the Romans visions, whereby things absent\nare presented to our imagination with such extreme vividness that they seem actually to be before\nour very eyes. It is the man who is really sensitive to such impressions who will have the greatest\npower over the emotions. Some writers describe\nthe possessor of this power of vivid imagination,\nwhereby things, words and actions are presented\nin the most realistic manner, by the Greek word and it is a power which all may\nreadily acquire if they will. When the mind is unoccupied or is absorbed by fantastic hopes or daydreams, we are haunted by these visions of which\nI am speaking to such an extent that we imagine\nthat we are travelling abroad, crossing the sea, fighting, addressing the people, or enjoying the use of\nwealth that we do not actually possess, and seem\nto ourselves not to be dreaming but acting. Surely,\nthen, it may be possible to turn this form of hallucination to some profit. I am complaining that a man\nhas been murdered. Shall I not bring before my\neyes all the circumstances which it is reasonable to\nimagine must have occurred in such a connexion\nShall I not see the assassin burst suddenly from his\nhiding-place, the victim tremble, cry for help, beg\nfor mercy, or turn to run Shall I not see the fatal\nblow delivered and the stricken body fall Will\nnot the blood, the deathly pallor, the groan of\nagony, the death-rattle, be indelibly impressed upon\nmy mind From such impressions arises that which\nCicero calls illumination and actuality, which makes\nus seem not so much to narrate as to exhibit the\nactual scene, while our emotions will be no less\nactively stirred than if we were present at the actual occurrence. Is it not from visions such as these that\nVergil was inspired to write Or, or the description of the horse at the funeral of\nPallas,  And how vivid\nwas the image of death conceived by the poet when\nhe wrote- \nAgain, when we desire to awaken pity, we must\nactually believe that the ills of which we complain\nhave befallen our own selves, and must persuade\nour minds that this is really the case. We must\nidentify ourselves with the persons of whom we\ncomplain that they have suffered grievous, unmerited\nand bitter misfortune, and must plead their case and\nfor a brief space feel their suffering as though it\nwere our own, while our words must be such as we\nshould use if we stood in their shoes. I have often\nseen actors, both in tragedy and comedy, leave the\ntheatre still drowned in tears after concluding the\nperformance of some moving role. But if the mere\ndelivery of words written by another has the power\nto set our souls on fire with fictitious emotions, what\nwill the orator do whose duty it is to picture to\nhimself the facts and who has it in his power to feel\nthe same emotion as his client whose interests are\nat stakeEven in the schools it is desirable that\nthe student should be moved by his theme, and\nshould imagine it to be true; indeed, it is all the\nmore desirable then, since, as a rule in scholastic declamations, the speaker more often appears as the\nactual litigant than as his advocate. Suppose we are\nimpersonating an orphan, a shipwrecked man, or one\nin grave peril. What profit is there in assuming\nsuch a rle unless we also assume the emotions\nwhich it involves I have thought it necessary not\nto conceal these considerations from my reader, since\nthey have contributed to the acquisition of such\nreputation for talent as I possess or once possessed.\nI have frequently been so much moved while speaking, that I have not merely been wrought upon to\ntears, but have turned pale and shown all the\nsymptoms of genuine grief. I now turn to a very different talent, namely\nthat which dispels the graver emotions of the judge\nby exciting his laughter, frequently diverts his attention from the facts of the case, and sometimes even\nrefreshes him and revives him when he has begun\nto be bored or wearied by the case. How hard it\nis to attain success in this connexion is shown by\nthe cases of the two great masters of Greek and\nRoman oratory. For many think that Demosthenes\nwas deficient in this faculty, and that Cicero used\nit without discrimination. Indeed, it is impossible\nto suppose that Demosthenes deliberately avoided\nall display of humour, since his few jests are so\nunworthy of his other excellences that they clearly\nshow that he lacked the power, not merely that he\ndisliked to use it. Cicero, on the other hand, was\nregarded as being unduly addicted to jests, not\nmerely outside the courts, but in his actual speeches\nas well. Personally though whether I am right in\nthis view, or have been led astray by an exaggerated\nadmiration for the prince of orators, I cannot say, I regard him as being the possessor of a remarkable\nturn of wit. For his daily speech was full of humour,\nwhile in his disputes in court and in his examination\nof witnesses he produced more good jests than any\nother, while the somewhat insipid jokes which he\nlaunches against Verres are always attributed by him\nto others and produced as evidence wherefore, the\nmore vulgar they are, the more probable is it that\nthey are not the invention of the orator, but were\ncurrent as public property. I wish, however, that\nTiro, or whoever it may have been that published\nthe three books of Cicero's jests, had restricted their\nnumber and had shown more judgment in selecting\nthan zeal in collecting them. For he would then\nhave been less exposed to the censure of his calumniators, although the latter will, in any case, as in\nregard to all the manifestations of his genius, find\nit easier to detect superfluities than deficiencies.\nThe chief difficulty which confronts the orator in\nthis connexion lies in the fact that sayings designed\nto raise a laugh are generally untrue and falsehood\nalways involves a certain meanness, and are often\ndeliberately distorted, and, further, never complimentary while the judgments formed by the audience\non such jests will necessarily vary, since the effect of\na jest depends not on the reason, but on an emotion\nwhich it is difficult, if not impossible, to describe. For\nI do not think that anybody can give an adequate\nexplanation, though many have attempted to do so, of\nthe cause of laughter, which is excited not merely\nby words or deeds, but sometimes even by touch.\nMoreover, there is great variety in the things which\nraise a laugh, since we laugh not merely at those\nwords or actions which are smart or witty, but also at those which reveal folly, anger or fear. Consequently, the cause of laughter is uncertain, since\nlaughter is never far removed from derision. For,\nas Cicero says, and whereas,\nwhen we point to such a blemish in others, the\nresult is known as wit, it is called folly when the\nsame jest is turned against ourselves. Now, though laughter may be regarded as a trivial\nmatter, and an emotion frequently awakened by\nbuffoons, actors or fools, it has a certain imperious\nforce of its own which it is very hard to resist. It\noften breaks out against our will and extorts confession of its power, not merely from our face and\nvoice, but convulses the whole body as well. Again,\nit frequently turns the scale in matters of great\nimportance, as I have already observed for instance,\nit often dispels hatred or anger. A proof of this is\ngiven by the story of the young men of Tarentum,\nwho had made a number of scurrilous criticisms of\nPyrrhus over the dinner table they were called\nupon to answer for their statements, and, since the\ncharge was one that admitted neither of denial nor\nof excuse, they succeeded in escaping, thanks to a\nhappy jest which made the king laugh for one of\nthe accused said, a jest\nwhich succeeded in dissipating the animosity which\nthe charge had aroused. Still, whatever the essence of humour may be, and\nalthough I would not venture to assert that it is altogether independent of art for it involves a certain\npower of observation, and rules for its employment\nhave been laid down by writers both of Greece and Rome, I will insist on this much, that it depends\nmainly on nature and opportunity. The influence\nof nature consists not merely in the fact that one\nman is quicker or cleverer than another in the\ninvention of jests for such a power can be increased\nby teaching, but also in the possession of some\npeculiar charm of look or manner, the effect of which\nis such that the same remarks would be less entertaining if uttered by another. Opportunity, on the\nother hand, is dependent on circumstances, and is of\nsuch importance that with its assistance not merely\nthe unlearned, but even mere country bumpkins are\ncapable of producing effective witticisms while\nmuch again may depend on some previous remark\nmade by another which will provide opportunity for\nrepartee. For wit always appears to greater advantage in reply than in attack. We are also confronted by the additional difficulty that there are\nno specific exercises for the development of humour\nnor professors to teach it. Consequently, while\nconvivial gatherings and conversation give rise to\nfrequent displays of wit, since daily practice develops\nthe faculty, oratorical wit is rare, for it has no fixed\nrules to guide it, but must adapt itself to the ways\nof the world. There has, however, never been anything to prevent the composition of themes such as\nwill afford scope for humour, so that our controversial declamations may have an admixture of jests,\nwhile special topics may be set which will give the\nyoung student practice in the play of wit. Nay,\neven those pleasantries in which we indulge on\ncertain occasions of festive licence and to which we\ngive the name of mots, as, indeed, they are, if only\na little more good sense were employed in their invention, and they were seasoned by a slight admixture of seriousness, might afford a most useful\ntraining. As it is, they serve merely to divert the\nyoung and merrymakers. There are various names by which we describe\nwit, but we have only to consider them separately\nto perceive their specific meaning. First, there is\nurbanitas, which I observe denotes language with a\nsmack of the city in its words, accent and idiom,\nand further suggests a certain tincture of learning\nderived from associating with well-educated men;\nin a word, it represents the opposite of rusticity.\nThe meaning of venustus is obvious; it means that\nwhich is said with grace and charm. Salsus is, as\na rule, applied only to what is laughable but this\nis not its natural application, although whatever is\nlaughable should have the salt of wit in it. For\nCicero, when he says that whatever has the salt of\nwit is Attic, does not say this because persons of\nthe Attic school are specially given to laughter;\nand again when Catullus says he does not mean that there is nothing in her body to\ngive cause for laughter. When, therefore, we speak\nof the salt of wit, we refer to wit about which there\nis nothing insipid, wit, that is to say, which serves\nas a simple seasoning of language, a condiment which\nis silently appreciated by our judgment, as food is\nappreciated by the palate, with the result that it\nstimulates our taste and saves a speech from becoming tedious. But just as salt, if sprinkled freely\nover food, gives a special relish of its own, so long\nas it is not used to excess, so in the case of those\nwho have the salt of wit there is something about their language which arouses in us a thirst to hear.\nAgain, I do not regard the epithet facelus as applicable solely to that which raises a laugh. If that\nwere so Horace would never have said that nature\nhad granted Vergil the gift of being facetus in song.\nI think that the term is rather applied to a certain\ngrace and polished elegance. This is the meaning\nwhich it bears in Cicero's letters, where he quotes\nthe words of Brutus, This\nmeaning suits the passage in Horace, to which I\nhave already made reference, locus is usually taken to mean\nthe opposite of seriousness. This view is, however,\nsomewhat too narrow. For to feign, to terrify, or to\npromise, are all at times forms of jesting. Dicacitas\nis no doubt derived from dico, and is therefore\ncommon to all forms of wit, but is specially applied\nto the language of banter, which is a humorous form\nof attack. Therefore, while the critics allow that\nDemosthenes was urbanus, they deny that he was\ndicax. The essence, however, of the subject which we\nare now discussing is the excitement of laughter,\nand consequently the whole of this topic is entitled by the Greeks. It has the same primary\ndivision as other departments of oratory, that is to\nsay, it is concerned with things and words. The\napplication of humour to oratory may be divided\ninto three heads for there are three things out of\nwhich we may seek to raise a laugh, to wit, others,\nourselves, or things intermediate. In the first case\nwe either reprove or refute or make light of or\nretort or deride the arguments of others. In the second we speak of things which concern ourselves in a humorous manner and, to quote the\nwords of Cicero, say things which have a suggestion of absurdity. For there are certain sayings\nwhich are regarded as folly if they slip from us\nunawares, but as witty if uttered ironically. The\nthird kind consists, as Cicero also tells us, in cheating\nexpectations, in taking words in a different sense\nfrom what was intended, and in other things which\naffect neither party to the suit, and which I have,\ntherefore, styled intermediate. Further, things designed to raise a laugh may either be said or done.\nIn the latter case laughter is sometimes caused by\nan act possessing a certain element of seriousness\nas well, as in the case of Marcus Caelius the praetor,\nwho, when the consul Isauricus broke his curule\nchair, had another put in its place, the seat of which\nwas made of leather thongs, by way of allusion to\nthe story that the consul had once been scourged\nby his father sometimes, again, it is aroused by\nan act which passes the grounds of decency, as in\nthe case of Caelius' box, a jest which was not fit\nfor an orator or any respectable man to make. On\nthe other hand the joke may lie in some remark\nabout a ridiculous look or gesture; such jests are\nvery attractive, more especially when delivered with\nevery appearance of seriousness; for there are no\njests so insipid as those which parade the fact that\nthey are intended to be witty. Still, although the\ngravity with which a jest is uttered increases its\nattraction, and the mere fact that the speaker does\nnot laugh himself makes his words laughable, there\nis also such a thing as a humorous look, manner or gesture, provided always that they observe the happy\nmean. Further, a jest will either be free and lively,\nlike the majority of those uttered by Aulus Galba,\nor abusive, like those with which Junius Bassus\nrecently made us familiar, or bitter, like those of\nCassius Severus, or gentle, like those of Domitius\nAfer. Much depends on the occasion on which a\njest is uttered. For in social gatherings and the intercourse of every day a certain freedom is not unseemly\nin persons of humble rank, while liveliness is becoming to all. Our jests should never be designed\nto wound, and we should never make it our ideal\nto lose a friend sooner than lose a jest. Where the\nbattles of the courts are concerned I am always\nbetter pleased when it is possible to indulge in\ngentle raillery, although it is, of course, permissible\nto be abusive or bitter in the words we use against\nour opponents, just as it is permissible to accuse\nthem openly of crime, and to demand the last penalty\nof the law. But in the courts as elsewhere it is\nregarded as inhuman to hit a man when he is down,\neither because he is the innocent victim of misfortune or because such attacks may recoil on those\nwho make them. Consequently, the first points to\nbe taken into consideration are who the speaker\nis, what is the nature of the case, who is the judge,\nwho is the victim, and what is the character of\nthe remarks that are made. It is most unbecoming\nfor an orator to distort his features or use uncouth\ngestures, tricks that arouse such merriment in farce.\nNo less unbecoming are ribald jests, and such as\nare employed upon the stage. As for obscenity, it\nshould not merely be banished from his language,\nbut should not even be suggested. For even if our opponent has rendered himself liable to such a\ncharge, our denunciation should not take the form\nof a jest. Further, although I want my orator to\nspeak with wit, he must not give the impression of\nstriving after it. Consequently lie must not display\nhis wit on every possible occasion, but must sacrifice\na jest sooner than sacrifice his dignity. Again, no\none will endure an accuser who employs jests to\nseason a really horrible case, nor an advocate for the\ndefence who makes merry over one that calls for pity.\nMoreover, there is a type of judge whose temperament is too serious to allow him to tolerate laughter.\nIt may also happen that a jest directed against an\nopponent may apply to the judge or to our own client,\nalthough there are some orators who do not refrain\neven from jests that may recoil upon themselves.\nThis was the case with Sulpicius Longus, who,\ndespite the fact that he was himself surpassingly\nhideous, asserted of a man against whom he was\nappearing in a case involving his status as a free\nman, that even his face was the face of a slave. To\nthis Domitius Afer replied, Insolence and arrogance are likewise to\nbe avoided, nor must our jests seem unsuitable to\nthe time or place, or give the appearance of studied\npremeditation, or smell of the lamp, while those\ndirected against the unfortunate are, as I have\nalready said, inhuman. Again, some advocates are\nmen of such established authority and such known\nrespectability, that any insolence shown them\nwould only hurt the assailant. As regards the\nway in which we should deal with friends I have\nalready given instructions. It is the duty not merely of an orator, but of any reasonable human being,\nwhen attacking one whom it is dangerous to offend\nto take care that his remarks do not end in exciting\nserious enmity, or the necessity for a grovelling\napology. Sarcasm that applies to a number of\npersons is injudicious I refer to cases where it is\ndirected against whole nations or classes of society,\nor against rank and pursuits which are common to\nmany. A good man will see that everything he\nsays is consistent with his dignity and the respectability of his character; for we pay too dear for the\nlaugh we raise if it is at the cost of our own integrity. It is, however, a difficult task to indicate the\nsources from which laughter may be legitimately\nderived or the topics where it may be naturally employed. To attempt to deal exhaustively with the\nsubject would be an interminable task and a waste\nof labour. For the topics suitable to jests are no\nless numerous than those from which we may derive\nreflexions, as they are called, and are, moreover,\nidentical with the latter. The powers of invention\nand expression come into play no less where jests\nare concerned, while as regards expression its force\nwill depend in part on the choice of words, in part\non the figures employed. Laughter then will be\nderived either from the physical appearance of our\nopponent or from his character as revealed in his\nwords and actions, or from external sources; for all\nforms of raillery come under one or other of these\nheads; if the raillery is serious, we style it as\nsevere; if, on the other hand, it is of a lighter\ncharacter, we regard it as humorous. These themes\nfor jest may be pointed out to the eye or described\nin words or indicated by some mot. It is only on rare occasions that it is possible to make them\nvisible to the eye, as Gaius Julius did when Helvius Mancia kept clamouring against him. he cried, and then, as\nMancia persisted in asking him to do so, pointed\nwith his finger at the picture of a Gaul painted on\na Cimbric shield, a figure to which Mancia bore a\nstriking resemblance. There were shops round the\nforum and the shield had been hung up over one\nof them by way of a sign. The narration of a\nhumorous story may often be used with clever effect\nand is a device eminently becoming to an orator.\nGood examples are the story told of Caepasius and\nFabricius, which Cicero tells in the pro Cluentio, or\nthe story told by Caelius of the dispute between\nDecimus Laelius and his colleague when they were\nboth in a hurry to reach their province first. But\nin all such cases the whole narrative must possess\nelegance and charm, while the orator's own contribution to the story should be the most humorous\nelement. Take for instance the way in which Cicero\ngives a special relish to the flight of Fabricius. I will not quote the rest of the passage,\nfor it is well known. But he develops the theme still further although the plain facts amount simply\nto this, that Fabricius had left the court. The\nwhole of the story told by Caelius is full of wit and\ninvention, but the gem of the passage is its conclusion. Cicero\nthinks that humour belongs to narrative and wit to\nsallies against the speaker's antagonist. Domitius\nAfer showed remarkable finish in this department;\nfor, while narratives of the kind I have described\nare frequent in his speeches, several books have been\npublished of his witticisms as well. This latter form\nof wit lies not merely in sallies and brief displays of\nwit, but may be developed at greater length, witness\nthe story told by Cicero in the second book of his\nde Oratore, in which Lucius Crassus dealt with\nBrutus, against whom he was appearing in court.\nBrutus was prosecuting Cnaeus Plancus and had\nproduced two readers to show that Lucius Crassus,\nwho was counsel for the defence, in the speech\nwhich he delivered on the subject of the colony of\nNarbo had advocated measures contrary to those\nwhich he recommended in speaking of the Servilian\nlaw. Crassus, in reply, called for three readers and\ngave them the dialogues of Brutus' father to read\nout. One of these dialogues was represented as\ntaking place on his estate at Privernum, the second\non his estate at Alba, and the third on his estate at\nTibur. Crassus then asked where these estates were.\nNow Brutus had sold them all, and in those days it\nwas considered somewhat discreditable to sell one's paternal acres. Similar attractive effects of narrative\nmay be produced by the narration of fables or at\ntimes even of historical anecdotes. On the other hand brevity in wit gives greater\npoint and speed. It may be employed in two ways,\naccording as we are the aggressors, or are replying\nto our opponents; the method, however, in both\ncases is to some extent the same. For there is\nnothing that can be said in attack that cannot\nbe used in riposte. But there are certain points\nwhich are peculiar to reply. For remarks designed\nfor attack are usually brought ready-made into\ncourt, after long thought at home, whereas those\nmade in reply are usually improvised during a dispute or the cross-examination of witnesses. But\nthough there are many topics on which we may\ndraw for our jests, I must repeat that not all these\ntopics are becoming to orators above all doubles\nentendres and obscenity, such as is dear to the Atellan\nfarce, are to be avoided, as also are those coarse\njibes so common on the lips of the rabble, where\nthe ambiguity of words is turned to the service of\nabuse. I cannot even approve of a similar from of\njest, that sometimes slipped out even from Cicero,\nthough not when he was pleading in the courts\nfor example, once when a candidate, alleged to be\nthe son of a cook, solicited someone else's vote in\nhis presence, he said, Ego quoque tibi favebo. I say\nthis not because I object absolutely to all play on\nwords capable of two different meanings, but because\nsuch jests are rarely effective, unless they are helped\nout by actual facts as well as similarity of sound. For example, I regard the jest which Cicero levelled\nagainst that same Isauricus, whom I mentioned\nabove, as being little less than sheer buffoonery. he said, On the other hand, the following\ninstance of the same type of wit is quite admirable\nwhen Milo's accuser, by way of proving that he had\nlain in wait for Clodius, alleged that he had put up\nat Bovillae before the ninth hour in order to wait\nuntil Clodius left his villa, and kept repeating the\nquestion, , Cicero replied, a retort which in itself justifies us\nin refusing to exclude this type of wit altogether.\nSometimes, too, the same word may be used not\nmerely in several senses, but in absolutely opposite\nsenses. For example, Nero said of a dishonest\nslave, Such ambiguity may even go so far as to present all the\nappearance of a riddle, witness the jest that Cicero\nmade at the expense of Pletorius, the accuser of\nFonteius he said, The explanation is that in her lifetime women\nof infamous character used to frequent her\nhouse, while after her death her property was\nsold. I may note however that ludus, is used\nmetaphorically in the sense of school, while\nmagisiri is used ambiguously. A similar form of jest may be made by use of the figure known as\nmetalepsis, as when Fabius Maximus complained of\nthe meagreness of the gifts made by Augustus to\nhis friends, and said that his congiaria were heminaria for congiarium implies at once liberality and\na particular measure, and Fabius put a slight on the\nliberality of Augustus by a reference to the measure.\nThis form of jest is as poor as is the invention of\npunning names by the addition, subtraction or change\nof letters I find, for instance, a case where a certain\nAcisculus was called Pacisculus because of some which he had made, while one Placidus\nwas nicknamed Acidus because of his temper,\nand one Tullius was dubbed Tollius because he was\na thief. Such puns are more successful with things\nthan names. It was, for example, a neat hit of\nAfer's when he said that Manlius Sura, who kept\nrushing to and fro while he was pleading, waving\nhis hands, letting his toga fall and replacing it, was\nnot merely pleading, but giving himself a lot of\nneedless trouble. For there is a spice of wit about\nthe word satagere in itself, even if there were no\nresemblance to any other word. Similar jests may\nbe produced by the addition or removal of the\naspirate, or by splitting up a word or joining it to\nanother the effect is generally poor, but the practice\nis occasionally permissible. Jests drawn from names\nare of the same type. Cicero introduces a number\nof such jests against Verres, but always as quotations from others. On one occasion he says that he\nwould sweep everything away, for his name was\nVerres; on another, that he had given more trouble\nto Hercules, whose temple he had pillaged, than\nwas given by the Erymanthine ; on another,\nthat he was a bad who had left so worthless\na pig behind him. For Verres' predecessor was\nnamed Sacerdos. Sometimes, however, a lucky\nchance may give us an opportunity of employing\nsuch jests with effect, as for instance when Cicero\nin the pro Caecina says of the witness Sextus\nClodius Phormio, We may note therefore that jests which turn on\nthe meaning of things are at once more pointed and\nmore elegant. In such cases resemblances between\nthings produce the best effects, more especially\nif we refer to something of an inferior or more trivial\nnature, as in the jests of which our forefathers were\nso fond, when they called Lentulus Spinther and\nScipio Serapio. But such jests may be drawn not\nmerely from the names of men, but from animals as\nwell; for example when I was a boy, Junius Bassus,\none of the wittiest of men, was nicknamed the white\nass. And Sarmentus compared Messius Cicirrus\nto a wild horse. The comparison may also be\ndrawn from inanimate objects for example Publius\nBlessius called a certain Julius, who was dark, lean\nand bent, the iron buckle. This method of raising\na laugh is much in vogue to-day. Such resemblances may be put to the service of wit either openly or\nallusively. Of the latter type is the remark of\nAugustus, made to a soldier who showed signs of\ntimidity in presenting a petition, Some\nof these jests turn on similarity of meaning. Of\nthis kind was the witticism uttered by Vatinius when\nhe was prosecuted by Calvus. Vatinius was wiping\nhis forehead with a white handkerchief, and his\naccuser called attention to the unseemliness of the\nact. Whereupon Vatinius replied, Still more ingenious is the application of\none thing to another on the ground of some resemblance, that is to say the adaptation to one thing of\na circumstance which usually applies to something\nelse, a type of jest which we may regard as being an\ningenious form of fiction. For example, when ivory\nmodels of captured towns were carried in Caesar's\ntriumphal procession, and a few days later wooden\nmodels of the same kind were carried at the triumph\nof Fabius Maximus, Chrysippus remarked that the\nlatter were the cases for Caesar's ivory towns. And\nPedo said of a heavy-armed gladiator who was\npursuing another armed with a net and failed to\nstrike him, Resemblance and ambiguity may be used in conjunction\nGalba for example said to a man who stood very\nmuch at his ease when playing ball, The ambiguity lies in the word stand, while the indifference\nshewn by the player supplies the resemblance. I\nneed say no more on this form of humour. But the\npractice of combining different types of jest is very\ncommon, and those are best which are of this composite character. A like use may be made of dissimilarity. Thus a Roman knight was once drinking\nat tile games, and Augustus sent him the following\nmessage, To which\nthe other replied, Contraries give rise to more than\none kind of jest. For instance the following jests\nmade by Augustus and Galba differ in form. Augustus\nwas engaged in dismissing an officer with dishonour\nfrom his service the officer kept interrupting him\nwith entreaties and said, Augustus replied, Galba, when a friend asked\nhim for the loan of a cloak, said, the point being\nthat the rain was pouring through the roof of his\ngarret at the time. I will add a third example,\nalthough out of respect to its author I withhold his\nname where\nwe are surprised by the appearance of a word which\nis the very opposite of what we should have expected.\nUnder the same heading, although it is quite\ndifferent from any of the preceding, we must place\nthe remark made by Marcus Vestinus when it was\nreported to him that a certain man was dead. was his reply.\nBut I shall overload this book with illustrations and\nturn it into a common jest-book, if I continue to\nquote each jest that was made by our forefathers. All forms of argument afford equal opportunity for\njests. Augustus for example employed definition\nwhen he said of two ballet-dancers who were engaged\nin a contest, turn and turn about, as to who could make\ntile most exquisite gestures, that one was a dancer and\nthe other merely interrupted the dancing. Galba on\nthe other hand made use of partition when he replied\nto a friend who asked him for a cloak, Similar material for jests is supplied by genus, species, property, difference, conjugates, adjuncts, antecedents, consequents, contraries,\ncauses, effects, and comparisons of things greater,\nequal, or less, as it is also by all forms of trope. Are\nnot a large number of jests made by means of hyperbole Take for instance Cicero's remark about a\nman who was remarkable for his height, or the remark\nmade by Publius Oppius about the family of the\nLentuli to the effect, that since the children were\nalways smaller than their parents, the race would Again, what of irony Is not\neven the most severe form of irony a kind of jest\nAfer made a witty use of it when he replied to Didius\nCallus, who, after making the utmost efforts to secure\na provincial government, complained on receiving\nthe appointment that he had been forced into accepting, Cicero also employed metaphor to serve\nhis jest, when on receiving a report of uncertain\nauthorship to the effect that Vatinius was dead,\nhe remarked, He also employed\nallegory in the witticism that he was fond of making\nabout Marcus Caelius, who was better at bringing\ncharges than at defending his client against them, to\nthe effect that he had a good right hand, but a weak\nleft. As an example of the use of emphasis I may\nquote the jest of Aulus Villius, that Tuccius was\nkilled by his sword falling upon him. Figures of\nthought, which the Greeks call may\nbe similarly employed, and some writers have classified jests under their various headings. For we ask\nquestions, express doubts, make assertions, threaten,\nwish and speak in pity or in anger. And everything\nis laughable that is obviously a pretence. It is easy\nto make fun of folly, for folly is laughable in itself;\nbut we may improve such jests by adding something\nof our own. Titius Maximus put a foolish question\nto Campatius, who was leaving the theatre, when he\nasked him if he had been watching the play. replied Campatius, whereby lie made the question seem even more\nfoolish than it actually was. Refutation consists in denying, rebutting, defending or making light of a charge, and each of these\naffords scope for humour. Manius Curius, for example,\nshowed humour in the way in which he denied a\ncharge that had been brought against him. His\naccuser had produced a canvas, in every scene of\nwhich he was depicted either as naked and in prison\nor as being restored to freedom by his friends paying\noff his gambling debts. His only comment was, Sometimes we rebut a charge openly, as Cicero did when he refuted the\nextravagant lies of Vibius Curius about his age he remarked, At other times we may rebut\nit by pretending to agree. Cicero, for example, when\nFabia the wife of Dolabella asserted that her age was\nthirty, remarked, Sometimes too it is\neffective to add something more biting in place of\nthe charge which is denied, as was done by Junius\nBassus when Domitia the wife of Passienus complained that by way of accusing her of meanness he\nhad alleged that she even sold old shoes. he replied, A witty travesty of defence\nwas once produced by a Roman knight who was\ncharged by Augustus with having squandered his\npatrimony. he answered. As regards making light of a charge, there\nare two ways in which this may be done. We may\nthrow cold water on the excessive boasted of our\nopponent, as was done by Gaius Caesar, when Pomponius displayed a wound in his face which he had\nreceived in the rebellion of Sulpicius and which he\nboasted he had received while fighting for Caesar he retorted, Or we may do the same\nwith some charge that is brought against us, as was\ndone by Cicero when he remarked to those who\nreproached him for marrying Publilia, a young unwedded girl, when he was already over sixty, Some style this\ntype of jest consequent and, on the ground that both jests seem to follow so naturally and inevitably, class\nit with the jest which Cicero levelled against Curio,\nwho always began his speeches by asking indulgence\nfor his youth he said. Another method of making\nlight of a statement is to suggest a reason. Cicero\nemployed this method against Vatinius. The latter\nwas lame and, wishing to make it seem that his health\nwas improved, said that he could now walk as much\nas two miles. said Cicero, Again Augustus, when the inhabitants of\nTarraco reported that a palm had sprung up on the\naltar dedicated to him, replied, Cassius Severus\nshowed his wit by transferring a charge made against\nhimself to a different quarter. For when lie was\nreproached by the praetor on the ground that his\nadvocates had insulted Lucius Varus, an Epicurean\nand a friend of Caesar, he replied, Of retorts there are a number of forms, the wittiest\nbeing that which is helped out by a certain verbal\nsimilarity, as in the retort made by Trachalus to\nSuelius. The latter had said,  to which Trachalus replied, Cassius Severus baffled an opponent who reproached\nhim with the fact that Proculeius had forbidden him\nto enter his house by replying, But one jest may also be defeated by another for\nexample, Augustus of blessed memory, when the\nGauls gave him a golden necklet weighing a hundred\npounds, and Dolabella, speaking in jest but with an eye to the success of his jest, said, replied, So, too, one lie may be\ndefeated by another Galba, for instance, when\nsomeone told him that he once bought a lamprey\nfive feet long for half a denarius in Sicily, replied, Then there is the opposite of denial, namely a feigned\nconfession, which likewise may show no small wit.\nThus Afer, when pleading against a freedman of\nClaudius Caesar and when another freedman called\nout from the opposite side of the court, replied, A\nsimilar trick is not to deny a charge, though it is\nobviously false and affords good opportunity for an\nexcellent reply. For example, when Philippus said\nto Catulus, the latter replied, To make jokes against oneself is\nscarcely fit for any save professed buffoons and is\nstrongly to be disapproved in an orator. This form\nof jest has precisely the same varieties as those which\nwe make against others and therefore I pass it by,\nalthough it is not infrequently employed. On the\nother hand scurrilous or brutal jests, although they\nmay raise a laugh, are quite unworthy of a gentleman. I remember a jest of this kind being made by a certain man against an inferior who had spoken\nwith some freedom against him In such cases it is difficult to say\nwhether the audience should laugh or be angry. There remains the prettiest of all forms of humour,\nnamely the jest which depends for success on deceiving anticipations or taking another's words in a\nsense other than he intended. The unexpected\nelement may be employed by the attacking party,\nas in the example cited by Cicero, or in the\nremark of Afer, Or it may be employed to\nmeet a statement made by another, as it was by\nCicero on hearing a false report of Vatinius' death\nhe had met one of the latter's freedmen and asked\nhim, The freedman answered, To which Cicero replied,\nBut the loudest laughter of all is produced by simulation and dissimulation, proceedings which differ but\nlittle and are almost identical; but whereas simulation\nimplies the pretence of having a certain opinion of\none's own, dissimulation consists in feigning that\none does not understand someone else's meaning.\nAfer employed simulation, when his opponents in a\ncertain case kept saying that Celsina who was an\ninfluential lady knew all about the facts, and he,\npretending to believe that she was a man, said, Cicero on the other hand employed dissimulation when Sextus Annalis gave evidence damaging\nto the client whom lie was defending, and the accuser\nkept pressing him with the question, To which he replied by beginning to recite the Sixth\nbook of the Annals of Ennius, which commences with\nthe line, This kind of jest finds its most frequent opportunity\nin ambiguity, as for example, when Cascellius, on\nbeing consulted by a client who said, replied, But there are also other ways of distorting the\nmeaning; we may for instance give a serious statement a comparatively trivial sense, like the man who,\nwhen asked what he thought of a man who had been\ncaught in the act of adultery, replied that he had\nbeen too slow in his movements. Of a similar nature\nare jests whose point lies in insinuation. Such was\nthe reply which Cicero quotes as given to the man\nwho complained that his wife had hung herself on a\nfig-tree. said someone, For there the meaning is obvious, though it is not expressed in so many\nwords. Indeed the essence of all wit lies in the\ndistortion of the true and natural meaning of words\na perfect instance of this is when we misrepresent\nour own or another's opinions or assert some impossibility. Juba misrepresented another man's opinion, when he replied to one who complained of\nbeing bespattered by his horse, Gaius Cassius misrepresented his own, when he said to a soldier whom he saw hurrying into battle without his sword, So\ntoo did Galba, when served with some fish that had\nbeen partially eaten the day before and had been\nplaced on the table with the uneaten sides turned\nuppermost he said, Lastly there is the jibe that Cicero\nmade against Curius, which I have already cited;\nfor it was clearly impossible that he should be still\nunborn at a time when he was already declaiming.\nThere is also a form of misrepresentation which has\nits basis in irony, of which a saying of Gaius Caesar\nwill provide an example. A witness asserted that\nthe accused attempted to wound him in the thighs,\nand although it would have been easy to ask him\nwhy he attacked that portion of his body above all\nothers, he merely remarked, Best of all is it when pretence is met by\npretence, as was done in the following instance by\nDomitius Afer. He had made his will long ago,\nand one of his more recent friends, in the hopes of\nsecuring a legacy if he could persuade him to change\nit, produced a fictitious story and asked him whether\nhe should advise a senior centurion who, being an old\nman, had already made his will to revise it; to which\nAfer replied, But the most agreeable of all jests are those which\nare good humoured and easily digested. Take\nanother example from Afer. Noting that an ungrateful client avoided him in the forum, he sent his\nservant to him to say, Again when his steward, being unable to account for certain sums\nof money, kept saying, he replied, Such jests the Greeks\nstyle or adapted to character. It is a\npleasant form of jest to reproach a person with less\nthan would be possible, as Afer did when, in answer\nto a candidate who said, he replied, although he might\neasily have denied the statement, Sometimes it may be a good joke to\nspeak of oneself, while one may often raise a laugh\nby reproaching a person to his face with things that\nit would have been merely bad-mannered to bring\nup against him behind his back. Of this kind was the\nremark made by Augustus, when a soldier was making some unreasonable request and Marcianus, whom\nhe suspected of intending to make some no less\nunfair request, turned up at the same moment Apt quotation of verse may add to the effect of\nwit. The lines may be quoted in their entirety\nwithout alteration, which is so easy a task that Ovid\ncomposed an entire book against bad poets out of\nlines taken from the quatrains of Macer. Such a\nprocedure is rendered specially attractive if it be\nseasoned by a spice of ambiguity, as in the line\nwhich Cicero quoted against Lartius, a shrewd and\ncunning fellow who was suspected of unfair dealing\nin a certain case, Or the words may be slightly altered, as in the line\nquoted against the senator who, although he had always in previous times been regarded as an utter\nfool, was, after inheriting an estate, asked to speak\nfirst on a motion where legacy is substituted for the original faculty.\nOr again we may invent verses resembling well known lines, a trick styled parody by the Greeks.\nA neat application of proverbs may also be effective,\nas when one man replied to another, a worthless\nfellow, who had fallen down and asked to be helped\nto his feet, Or we may shew our culture by drawing on legend for a jest, as Cicero did in the trial of\nVerres, when Hortensius said to him as he was\nexamining a witness, said Cicero, Hortensius had\nreceived a bronze Sphinx of great value as a present\nfrom Verres. Effects of mild absurdity are produced by the\nsimulation of folly and would, indeed, themselves,\nbe foolish were they not fictitious. Take as an\nexample the remark of the man who, when people\nwondered why he had bought a stumpy candlestick,\nsaid, There are also sayings closely resembling absurdities which derive\ngreat point from their sheer irrelevance, like the\nreply of Dolabella's slave, who, on being asked\nwhether his master had advertised a sale of his\nproperty, answered, Sometimes you may get out of a tight comer by\ngiving a humorous explanation of your embarrassment, as the man did who asked a witness, who\nalleged that lie had been wounded by the accused,\nwhether he had any scar to show for it. The witness\nproceeded to show a huge scar on his thigh, on which\nlie remarked, A happy use may also be made of insult.\nHispo, for example, when the accuser charged him\nwith scandalous crimes, replied, ; while Fulvius Propinquus,\nwhen asked by the representative of the emperor\nwhether the documents which he produced were\nautographs, replied, Such I have either learned from others or discovered from my own experience to be the commonest sources of humour. But I must repeat that\nthe number of ways in which one may speak wittily\nare of no less infinite variety than those in which one\nmay speak seriously, for they depend on persons,\nplace, time and chances, which are numberless. I\nhave, therefore, touched on the topics of humour\nthat I may not be taxed with having omitted them;\nbut with regard to my remarks on the actual practice and manner of jesting, I venture to assert that\nthey are absolutely indispensable. To these Domitius Marsus, who wrote an elaborate\ntreatise on Urbanity, adds several types of saying,\nwhich are not laughable, but rather elegant sayings\nwith a certain charm and attraction of their own,\nwhich are suitable even to speeches of the most\nserious kind they are characterized by a certain\nurbane wit, but not of a kind to raise a laugh. And as a matter of fact his work was not designed to deal\nwith humour, but with urbane wit, a quality which\nhe regards as peculiar to this city, though it was not\ntill a late period that it was understood in this sense,\nafter the word Urbs had come to be accepted as indicating Rome without the addition of any proper\nnoun. He defines it as follows But this\ndefinition, if we except the quality of brevity, includes all the virtues of oratory. For it is entirely\nconcerned with persons and things to deal with\nwhich in appropriate language is nothing more nor\nless than the task of perfect eloquence. Why he\ninsisted on brevity being essential I do not know,\nsince in the same book he asserts that many speakers\nhave revealed their urbanity in narrative. And a little\nlater he gives the following definition, which is, as\nhe says, based on the views expressed by Cato But if we\naccept these definitions, we shall have to allow the\ntitle of urbane to anything that is well said. It was\nnatural therefore that the author of this definition\nshould classify such sayings under three heads,\nserious, humorous and intermediate, since all good sayings may be thus classified. But, in my opinion,\nthere are certain forms of humorous saying that may\nbe regarded as not possessing sufficient urbanity. For\nto my thinking urbanity involves the total absence of\nall that is incongruous, coarse, unpolished and exotic\nwhether in thought, language, voice or gesture, and\nresides not so much in isolated sayings as in the\nwhole complexion of our language, just as for the\nGreeks Atticism means that elegance of taste which\nwas peculiar to Athens. However, out of respect to\nthe judgment of Marsus, who was a man of the\ngreatest learning, I will add that he divides serious\nutterances into three classes, the honorific, the\nderogatory and the intermediate. As an example\nof the honorific he quotes the words uttered by\nCicero in the pro Ligario with reference to Caesar, The\nderogatory he illustrates by the words used by\nCicero of Pompey and Caesar in a letter to Atticus Finally, he illustrates the intermediate, which he calls apophthegmatic as it is, by\nthe passage from Cicero's speech against Catiline\nwhere he says, All these\nare admirable sayings, but what special title they\nhave to be called urbane I do not see. If it is\nnot merely, as I think, the whole complexion of\nour oratory that deserves this title, but if it is to\nbe claimed for individual sayings as well, I should\ngive the name only to those sayings that are of\nthe same general character as humorous sayings,\nwithout actually being humorous. I will give an illustration of what I mean. It was said of Asinius\nPollio, who had equal gifts for being grave or gay,\nthat he was and of a pleader\nwho was a fluent speaker extempore, that Of the same kind,\ntoo, was the remark recorded by Marsus as having\nbeen made by Pompey to Cicero when the latter\nexpressed distrust of his party Had this last remark\nbeen uttered on a less serious subject and with less\nserious purpose, or had it not been uttered by Pompey\nhimself, we might have counted it among examples\nof humour. I may also add the words used by\nCicero in a letter to Caerellia to explain why he\nendured the supremacy of Caesar so patiently for here again the\nword has a spice of humour in it. I felt\nthat I ought not to conceal my feelings on this point.\nIf I am wrong in my views, I shall not, at any rate,\nlead my readers astray, since I have stated the opposite view as well, which they are at liberty to adopt\nif they prefer it. IV. With regard to the principles to be observed\nin forensic debate, it might seem that I should\ndelay such instructions until I had finished dealing\nwith all the details of continuous speaking, since\nsuch debates come after the set speeches are done.\nBut since the art of debate turns on invention alone,\ndoes not admit of arrangement, has little need for\nthe embellishments of style, and makes no large\ndemand on memory or delivery, I think that it will\nnot be out of place to deal with it here before I\nproceed to the second of the five parts, since it is entirely dependent on the first. Other writers have\nomitted to deal with it on the ground perhaps that\nthey thought the subject had been sufficiently covered\nby their precepts on other topics. For debate consists in attack and defence, on which enough has\nalready been said, since whatever is useful in a continuous speech for the purpose of proof must necessarily be of service in this brief and discontinuous\nform of oratory. For we say the same things in\ndebate, though we say them in a different manner,\nsince debate consists of questions and replies, a topic\nwith which we have dealt fairly exhaustively in\nconnexion with the examination of witnesses. But\nsince this work is designed on an ample scale and\nsince no one can be called a perfect orator unless he\nbe an expert debater, we must devote a little special\nattention to this accomplishment as well, which as a\nmatter of fact is not seldom the deciding factor in a\nforensic victory. For just as the continuous speech\nis the predominant weapon in general questions of\nquality where the inquiry is as to whether an act\nwas right or wrong, and as a rule is adequate to\nclear up questions of definition and almost all those\nin which the facts are ascertained or inferred by\nconjecture from artificial proof, so on the other\nhand those cases, which are the most frequent of all\nand depend on proofs which are either entirely\ninartificial or of a composite character, give rise\nto the most violent debates; in fact I should say\nthat there is no occasion when the advocate has to\ncome to closer grips with his adversary. For all the\nstrongest points of the argument have to be sharply\nimpressed on the memory of the judge, while we\nhave also to make good all the promises we may have made in the course of our speech and to refute\nthe lies of our opponents. There is no point of a\ntrial where the judge's attention is keener. And\neven mediocre speakers have not without some reason\nacquired the reputation of being good advocates\nsimply by their excellence in debate. Some on the\nother hand think they have done their duty to their\nclients by an ostentatious and fatiguing display of\nelaborate declamation and straightway march out of\ncourt attended by an applauding crowd and leave the\ndesperate battle of debate to uneducated performers\nwho often are of but humble origin. As a result\nin private suits you will generally find that different\ncounsel are employed to plead and to prove the case.\nIf the duties of advocacy are to be thus divided, the\nlatter duty must surely be accounted the more\nimportant of the two, and it is a disgrace to oratory\nthat inferior advocates should be regarded as adequate\nto render the greater service to the litigants. In\npublic cases at any rate the actual pleader is cited\nby the usher as well as the other advocates.\nFor debate the chief requisites are a quick and\nnimble understanding and a shrewd and ready judgment. For there is no time to think; the advocate\nmust speak at once and return the blow almost\nbefore it has been dealt by his opponent. Consequently while it is most important for every portion\nof the case that the advocate should not merely have\ngiven a careful study to the whole case, but that he\nshould have it at his fingers' ends, when he comes\nto the debate it is absolutely necessary that he\nshould possess a thorough acquaintance with all the\npersons, instruments and circumstances of time and\nplace involved otherwise he will often be reduced to silence and forced to give a hurried assent to\nthose who prompt him as to what he should say,\nsuggestions which are often perfectly fatuous owing\nto excess of zeal on the part of the prompter. As a\nresult it sometimes happens that we are put to the\nblush by too ready acceptance of the foolish suggestions of another. Moreover, we have to deal with\nothers beside these prompters who speak for our ear\nalone. Somego so far as to turn the debate into an open\nbrawl. For you may sometimes see several persons\nshouting angrily at the judge and telling him that the\narguments thus suggested are contrary to the truth,\nand calling his attention to the fact that some point\nwhich is prejudicial to the case has been deliberately\npassed over in silence. Consequently the skilled\ndebater must be able to control his tendency to\nanger; there is no passion that is a greater enemy\nto reason, while it often leads an advocate right\naway from the point and forces him both to use\ngross and insulting language and to receive it in\nreturn; occasionally it will even excite him to such\nan extent as to attack the judges. Moderation, and\nsometimes even longsuffering, is the better policy,\nfor the statements of our opponents have not merely\nto be refuted they are often best treated with contempt, made light of or held up to ridicule, methods\nwhich afford unique opportunity for the display of\nwit. This injunction, however, applies only so long\nas the case is conducted with order and decency if,\non the other hand, our opponents adopt turbulent\nmethods we must put on a bold front and resist\ntheir impudence with courage. For there are some\nadvocates so brazen-faced that they bluster and\nbellow at us, interrupt us in the middle of a sentence and try to throw everything into confusion. While,\nthen, it would be wrong to pay them the compliment of imitation, we must none the less repel their\nonslaughts with vigour by crushing their insolence\nand making frequent appeals to the judges or presiding magistrates to insist on the observance of the\nproper order of speaking. The debater's task is\nnot one that suits a meek temper or excessive\nmodesty, and we are apt to be misled because that\nwhich is really weakness is dignified by the name of\nhonesty. But the quality which is the most serviceable in debate is acumen, which while it is not the\nresult of art for natural gifts cannot be taught,\nmay none the less be improved by art. In this\nconnexion the chief essential is never for a moment\nto lose sight either of the question at issue or the\nend which we have in view. If we bear this in\nmind, we shall never descend to mere brawling\nnor waste the time allotted to the case by indulging\nin abuse, while we shall rejoice if our adversary\ndoes so. Those who have given a careful study to the arguments that are likely to be produced by their\nopponents or the replies which may be made by\nthemselves are almost always ready for the fray.\nThere is, however, a further device available which\nconsists in suddenly introducing into the debate arguments which were deliberately concealed in our set\nspeech it is a procedure which resembles a surprise\nattack or a sally from an ambush. The occasion for\nits employment arises when there is some point to\nwhich it is difficult to improvise an answer, though\nit would not be difficult to meet if time were\nallowed for consideration. For solid and irrefutable arguments are best produced at once in the actual\npleading in order that they may be repeated and\ntreated at greater length. I think I need hardly\ninsist on the necessity for the avoidance in debate of\nmere violence and noise and such forms of pleasantry\nas are dear to tile uneducated. For unscrupulous\nviolence, although annoying to one's antagonist,\nmakes an unpleasant impression on the judge. It is\nalso bad policy to light hard for points which you\ncannot prove. For where defeat is inevitable, it is\nwisest to yield, since, if there are a number of other\npoints in dispute, we shall find it easier to prove\nwhat remains, while if there is only one point at\nissue, surrender with a good grace will generally\nsecure some mitigation of punishment. For obstinacy\nin the defence of a fault, more especially after detection, is simply the commission of a fresh fault. While the battle still rages, the task of luring on\nour adversary when he has once committed himself\nto error, and of forcing him to commit himself as\ndeeply as possible, even to the extent at times of\nbeing puffed up with extravagant hopes of success,\nrequires great prudence and skill. It is, therefore,\nwise to conceal some of our weapons for our\nopponents will often press their attack and stake\neverything on some imagined weakness of our own,\nand will give fresh weight to our proofs by the\ninstancy with which they demand us to produce\nthem. It may even be expedient to yield ground\nwhich the enemy thinks advantageous to himself\nfor in grasping at the fancied advantage he may\nbe forced to surrender some greater advantage at\ntimes, too, it may serve our purpose to give him a\nchoice between two alternatives, neither of which he can select without damage to his cause. Such\na course is more effective in debate than in a set\nspeech, for the reason that in the latter we reply\nto ourselves, while in the former our opponent\nreplies, and thereby delivers himself into our hands.\nIt is, above all, the mark of a shrewd debater to\nperceive what remarks impress the judge and what\nhe rejects this may often be detected from his\nlooks, and sometimes from some action or utterance.\nArguments which help us must be pressed home,\nwhile it will be wise to withdraw as gently as\npossible from such as are of no service. We may\ntake a lesson from doctors who continue or cease\nto administer remedies according as they note that\nthey are received or rejected by the stomach.\nSometimes, if we find difficulty in developing our\npoint, it is desirable to raise another question and\nto divert the attention of the judge to it if this be\nfeasible. For what can you do, if you are unable\nto answer an argument, save invent another to which\nyour opponent can give no answer In most respects the rules to be observed in debate are, as I\nhave said, identical with those for the cross examination of witnesses, the only difference lying in the\nfact that the debate is a battle between advocates,\nwhereas cross-examination is a fight between advocate\nand witness. To practise the art of debate is, however, far\neasier. For it is most profitable to agree with\na fellow-student on some subject, real or fictitious,\nand to take different sides, debating it as would\nbe done in the courts. The same may also be\ndone with the simpler class of questions. I\nwould further have an advocate realise the order in which his proofs should be presented to the judge\nthe method to be followed is the same as in arguments the strongest should be placed first and\nlast. For those which are presented first dispose\nthe judge to believe us, and those which come last\nto decide in our favour. V. Having dealt with these points to the best of\nmy ability, I should have had no hesitation in proceeding to discuss arrangement, which is logically\nthe next consideration, did I not fear that, since\nthere are some who include judgment under the\nhead of invention, they might think that I had\ndeliberately omitted all discussion of judgment,\nalthough personally I regard it as so inextricably\nblent with and involved in every portion of this\nwork, that its influence extends even to single\nsentences or words, and it is no more possible to\nteach it than it is to instruct the powers of taste\nand smell. Consequently, all I can do is now and\nhereafter to show what should be done or avoided\nin each particular case, with a view thereby to guide\nthe judgment. What use then is it for me to lay\ndown general rules to the effect that we should not\nattempt impossibilities, that we should avoid whatever contradicts our case or is common to both, and\nshun all incorrectness or obscurity of style In all\nthese cases it is common sense that must decide,\nand common sense cannot be taught. There is no great difference, in my opinion,\nbetween judgment and sagacity, except that the\nformer deals with evident facts, while the latter is\nconcerned with hidden facts or such as have not\nyet been discovered or still remain in doubt. Again\njudgment is more often than not a matter of certainty, while sagacity is a form of reasoning from\ndeep-lying premises, which generally weighs and\ncompares a number of arguments and in itself\ninvolves both invention and judgment. But here\nagain you must not expect me to lay down any\ngeneral rules. For sagacity depends on circumstances\nand will often find its scope in something preceding\nthe pleading of the cause. For instance in the prosecution of Verres Cicero seems to have shown the\nhighest sagacity in preferring to cut down the time\navailable for his speech rather than allow the trial to\nbe postponed to the following year when Quintus\nHortensius was to be consul. And again in the\nactual pleading sagacity holds the first and most\nimportant place. For it is the duty of sagacity to\ndecide what we should say and what we should pass\nby in silence or postpone; whether it is better to\ndeny an act or to defend it, when we should employ\nan exordium and on what lines it should be designed,\nwhether we should make a statement of facts and if\nso, how, whether we should base our plea on law or\nequity and what is the best order to adopt, while it\nmust also decide on all the nuances of style, and\nsettle whether it is expedient to speak harshly,\ngently or even with humility. But I have already\ngiven advice on all these points as far as each\noccasion permitted, and I shall continue to do the\nsame in the subsequent portions of this work. In\nthe meantime, however, I will give a few instances\nto make my meaning clearer, since it is not possible,\nin my opinion, to do so by laying down general rules.\nWe praise Demosthenes for his sagacity because\nwhen he urged a policy of war upon the Athenians\nafter they had met with a series of reverses, he pointed out that so far their action had been entirely\nirrational. For they might still make amends for their\nnegligence, whereas, if they had made no mistakes,\nthey would have had no ground for hopes of better\nsuccess in the future. Again, since he feared to\ngive offence if he taxed the people with lack of\nenergy in defending the liberties of their country,\nhe preferred to praise their ancestors for their\ncourageous policy. Thus lie gained a ready hearing,\nwith the natural result that the pride which they\nfelt in the heroic past made them repent of their\nown degenerate behaviour. If we turn to Cicero, we\nshall find that one speech alone, the pro Cluenltio,\nwill suffice to provide a number of examples. The\ndifficulty is to know what special exhibition of sagacity to admire most in this speech. His opening\nstatement of the case, by which he discredited the\nmother whose authority pressed so hardly on her\nson The fact that he preferred to throw the\ncharge of having bribed the jury back upon his\nopponents rather than deny it on account of what he\ncalls the notorious infamy of the verdict Or his\nrecourse, last of all, to the support of the law in spite\nof the odious nature of the affair, a method by which\nlie would have set the judges against him but for\nthe fact that he had already softened their feelings\ntowards him Or the skill which lie shows in stating that he has adopted this course in spite of the\nprotests of his client What again am I to select as\nan outstanding instance of his sagacity in the pro\nMilone The fact that he refrains from proceeding\nto his statement of facts until he has cleared the\nground by disposing of the previous verdicts against\nthe accused The manner in which he turns the odium of the attempted ambush against Clodius,\nalthough as a matter of fact the encounter was a\npure chance The way in which he at one and the\nsame time praised the actual deed and showed that\nit was forced upon his client Or the skill with\nwhich he avoided making Milo plead for consideration and undertook the role of suppliant himself\nIt would be an endless task to quote all the instances\nof his sagacity, how he discredited Cotta, how he\nput forward his own case in defence of Ligarius and\nsaved Cornelius by his bold admission of the facts.\nIt is enough, I think, to say that there is nothing\nnot merely in oratory, but in all the tasks of life\nthat is more important than sagacity and that without it all formal instruction is given in vain, while\nprudence unsupported by learning will accomplish\nmore than learning unsupported by prudence. It is\nsagacity again that teaches us to adapt our speech to\ncircumstances of time and place and to the persons\nwith whom we are concerned. But since this topic\ncovers a wide field and is intimately connected with\neloquence itself, I shall reserve my treatment of it\ntill I come to give instructions on the subject of\nappropriateness in speaking. I think that enough has been said on the subject\nof invention. For I have dealt not merely with the\nmethods by which we may instruct the judge, but\nalso with the means of appealing to his emotions.\nBut just as it is not sufficient for those who are\nerecting a building merely to collect stone and timber\nand other building materials, but skilled masons are\nrequired to arrange and place them, so in speaking,\nhowever abundant the matter may be, it will merely\nform a confused heap unless arrangement be employed to reduce it to order and to give it connexion\nand firmness of structure. Nor is it without good\nreason that arrangement is treated as the second of\nthe five departments of oratory, since without it the\nfirst is useless. For the fact that all the limbs of a\nstatue have been cast does not make it a statue they\nmust be put together; and if you were to interchange some one portion of our bodies or of those\nof other animals with another, although the body\nwould be in possession of all the same members as before, you would none the less have produced\na monster. Again even a slight dislocation will\ndeprive a limb of its previous use and vigour, and\ndisorder in the ranks will impede the movements of an army. Nor can I regard as an error\nthe assertion that order is essential to the existence\nof nature itself, for without order everything would\ngo to wrack and ruin. Similarly if oratory lack this\nvirtue, it cannot fail to be confused, but will be\nlike a ship drifting without a helmsman, will lack\ncohesion, will fall into countless repetitions and\nomissions, and, like a traveller who has lost his way\nin unfamiliar country, will be guided solely by chance\nwithout fixed purpose or the least idea either of\nstarting-point or goal. The whole of this book, therefore, will be devoted\nto arrangement, an art the acquisition of which would\nnever have been such a rarity, had it been possible to\nlay down general rules which would suit all subjects.\nPut since cases in the courts have always presented\nan infinite variety, and will continue to do so, and\nsince through all the centuries there has never been\nfound one single case which was exactly like any\nother, the pleader must rely upon his sagacity, keep\nhis eyes open, exercise his powers of invention and\njudgment and look to himself for advice. On the\nother hand, I do not deny that there are some points\nwhich are capable of demonstration and which\naccordingly I shall be careful not to pass by. Division, as I have already stated, means the\ndivision of a group of things into its component\nparts, partition is the separation of an individual\nwhole into its elements, order the correct disposition of things in such a way that what follows coheres\nwith what precedes, while arrangement is the distribution of things and parts to the places which it is\nexpedient that they should occupy. But we must\nremember that arrangement is generally dependent\non expediency, and that the same question will not\nalways be discussed first by both parties. An\nexample of what I mean, to quote no others, is\nprovided by Demosthenes and Aeschines, who adopt\na different order in the trial of Ctesiphon, since the\naccuser begins by dealing with the legal question\ninvolved, in which he thought he had the advantage,\nwhereas the advocate for the defence treats practically every other topic before coming to the question\nof law, with a view to preparing the judges for a\nconsideration of the legal aspect of the case. For\nit will often be expedient for the parties to place\ndifferent points first; otherwise the pleading would\nalways be determined by the good pleasure of the\nprosecution. Finally, in a case of mutual accusation,\nwhere both parties have to defend themselves before\naccusing their antagonist, the order of everything\nmust necessarily be different. I shall therefore set\nforth the method adopted by myself, about which I\nhave never made any mystery it is the result in\npart of instruction received from others, in part of\nmy own reasoning. When engaged in forensic disputes I made it a\npoint to make myself familiar with every circumstance connected with the case. In the schools,\nof course, the facts of the case are definite and\nlimited in number and are moreover set out before\nwe begin to declaim the Greeks call them themes,\nwhich Cicero translates by propositions. When I had formed a general idea of these circumstances, I\nproceeded to consider them quite as much from my\nopponent's point of view as from my own. The\nfirst point which I set myself to determine it is\neasy enough to state, but is still all-important was\nwhat each party desired to establish and then what\nmeans he was likely to adopt to that end. My\nmethod was as follows. I considered what the\nprosecutor would say first his point must either be\nadmitted or controversial if admitted, no question\ncould arise in this connexion. I therefore passed to\nthe answer of the defence and considered it from the\nsame standpoint even there the point was sometimes one that was admitted. It was not until the\nparties ceased to agree that any question arose.\n'fake for example the following case. Agreed, I pass to\nthe defence, which has to produce the motive for\nthe homicide. lie urges, Another admitted\npoint, for there is no doubt about the law. We\nmust look for a third point where the two parties are\nat variance. say the\nprosecution; say the defence. Here\nthen is the question at issue there is a doubt as to\nthe facts, and it is therefore a question of conjecure.\nSometimes even the third point may be admitted;\nit is granted that they were adulterers. says\nthe accuser, or The question is now one of law. On the other\nhand, if when the prosecution says, the defence at once replies, the\nissue is raised without more delay. If it requires some search to discover where the\ndispute really begins, we must consider what constitutes the first question. The charge may be simple,\nas for example or\ncomplex like the following In the latter case there will be a\nnumber of propositions, a statement which also\napplies to civil suits as well. But in a complex case\nthere may be a number of questions and bases for\ninstance the accused may deny one fact, justify\nanother and plead technical grounds to show that\na third fact is not actionable. In such cases the\npleader will have to consider what requires refutation\nand where that refutation should be placed. As regards the prosecutor, I do not altogether\ndisagree with Celsus, who, though no doubt in so\ndoing he is following the practice of Cicero, insists\nwith some vehemence on the view that the first\nplace should be given to some strong argument,\nbut that the strongest should be reserved to the end,\nwhile the weaker arguments should be placed in the\nmiddle, since the judge has to be moved at the beginning and forcibly impelled to a decision at the end.\nBut with the defence it is different the strongest\narguments as a rule require to be disposed of first,\nfor fear that the judge through having his thoughts\nfixed on those arguments should regard the defence\nof other points with disfavour. Sometimes, however,\nthis order is subject to alteration; for example if the\nminor arguments are obviously false and the refutation of the most serious argument a matter of some difficulty, we should attack it last of all, after discrediting the prosecution by demonstrating the falsity\nof the former, thereby disposing the judges to believe that all their arguments are equally unreliable.\nWe shall, however, require to preface our remarks by\nexplaining why we postpone dealing with the most\nserious charge, and by promising that we will deal\nwith it at a later stage otherwise the fact that we do\nnot dispose of it at once may give the impression that\nwe are afraid of it. Charges brought against the\npast life of the accused should generally be dealt\nwith first in order that the judge may be well disposed to listen to our defence on that point on which\nlie has to give his verdict. But Cicero in the pro\nVareno postpones his treatment of such charges to\nthe conclusion, being guided not by the general rule,\nbut by the special circumstances of the case. When the accusation is simple, we must consider\nwhether to give a single answer to the charge or\nseveral. In the former case, we must decide\nwhether the question is one of fact or of law if it is\none of fact, we must deny the fact or justify it if, on\nthe other hand, it is a question of law, we must decide\non what special point the dispute arises and whether\nthe question turns on the letter or the intention of\nthe law. We shall do this by considering what the\nlaw is which gives rise to the dispute, that is to say\nunder what law the court has been constituted. In\nscholastic themes, for example, the laws are sometimes stated merely with a view to connecting the\narguments of the cases. Take the following case The law about children who have\nbeen exposed affords scope for emotional treatment,\nwhile the decision of the court turns on the law of\ndisinheritance. On the other hand, a question may\nturn on more laws than one, as in cases of or contradictory laws. It is by consideration of such\npoints as these that we shall be able to determine\nthe point of law out of which the dispute arises. As an example of complex defence I may quote\nthe pro Rabirio But when we advance a number of points in\nanswer to a single proposition, we must first of all\nconsider everything that can be said on the subject,\nand then decide which out of these points it is expedient to select and where to put them forward.\nMy views on this subject are not identical with\nthose which I admitted a little while ago on the\nsubject of propositions and on that of arguments in\nthe section which I devoted to proofs, to the effect\nthat we may sometimes begin with the strongest.\nFor when we are defending, there should always be an\nincrease of force in the treatment of questions and we\nshould proceed from the weaker to the stronger,\nwhether the points we raise are of the same or of a\ndifferent character. Questions of law will often arise\nfrom one ground of dispute after another, whereas\nquestions of fact are always concerned with one point; but the order to be followed is the same in both\ncases. We must, however, deal first with points that\ndiffer in character. In such cases the weakest\nshould always be handled first, for the reason that\nthere are occasions when after discussing a question\nwe make a concession or present of it to our opponents for we cannot pass on to others without\ndropping those which come first. This should be\ndone in such a way as to give the impression not\nthat we regard the points as desperate, but that we\nhave deliberately dropped them because we can\nprove our case without them. Suppose that the\nagent for a certain person claims the interest on a\nloan as due under an inheritance. The question may\nhere arise whether such a claim can be made by an\nagent. Assume that, after discussing the question,\nwe drop it or that the argument is refuted. We\nthen raise the question whether the person in whose\nname the action is brought has the right to employ\nan agent. Let us yield this point also. The case\nwill still admit of our raising the question whether\nthe person in whose name the suit is brought is\nheir to the person to whom the interest was due\nand again whether he is sole heir. Grant these\npoints also and we can still raise the question whether\nthe sum is due at all On the other hand, no one\nwill be so insane as to drop what he considers his\nstrongest point and pass to others of minor importance. The following case from a scholastic theme\nis of a similar character. Such is the nature of\ndissimilarity where points of law are concerned.\nWhere, however, the question is one of fact, there\nmay be several points all tending to the same result,\nof which some may be dropped as not essential to\nthe main issue, as for instance if a man accused of\ntheft should say to his accuser, The\nfirst three can be dropped, but not the last. I used also to employ the following method. I\nwent back from the ultimate species which generally\ncontains the vital point of the case to the first\ngeneral question or descended from the genus to the\nultimate species, applying this method even to deliberative themes. For example, Numa is deliberating\nwhether to accept the crown offered him by the\nRomans. First he considers the general question, Then, So too in controversial themes.\nSuppose a brave man to choose another man's wife\nas his reward. The ultimate species is found in the\nquestion whether lie is allowed to choose another\nman's wife. The general question is whether he\nshould be given whatever he chooses. Next come\nquestions such as whether he can choose his reward\nfrom the property of private individuals, whether he can choose a bride as his reward, and if so, whether\nhe can choose one who is already married. But in\nour search for such questions we follow an order\nquite different from that which we employ in actual\nspeaking. For that which as a rule occurs to us first,\nis just that which ought to come last in our speech\nas for instance the conclusion, Consequently undue\nhaste will spoil our division of the subject. We\nmust not therefore be content with the thoughts\nthat first offer themselves, but should press our\ninquiry further till we reach conclusions such as\nthat he ought not even to choose a widow a further\nadvance is made when we reach the conclusion that\nbe should choose nothing that is private property, or\nlast of all we may go back to the question next in\norder to the general question, and conclude that he\nshould choose nothing inequitable. Consequently\nafter surveying our opponent's proposition, an easy\ntask, we should consider, if possible, what it is most\nnatural to answer first. And, if we imagine the case\nas being actually pleaded and ourselves as under the\nnecessity of making a reply, that answer will probably suggest itself. On the other hand, if this is\nimpossible, we should put aside whatever first occurs\nto us and reason with ourselves as follows We must then repeat\nthe process a second and a third time and so on,\nuntil nothing is left for consideration. Thus we\nshall examine even minor points, by our treatment\nof which we may perhaps make the judge all the\nbetter disposed to us when we come to the main\nissue. The rule that we should descend from the\ncommon to the particular is much the same, since what is common is usually general. For example, is common, while are all particular. I used also to note down separately whatever was\nadmitted both by my opponent and myself, provided\nit suited my purpose, and not merely to press any\nadmissions that he might make, but to multiply\nthem by partition, as for example in the following\ncontroversial theme What points are admitted\nby both parties We try\nto find the traitor. For an act of the\naccused may sometimes be stated in such a way as\nto tell heavily against him, and if our statement\nmakes a real impression on the mind of the judge,\nit may serve to close his ears to all that is urged by\nthe defence. For as a general rule it is of advantage\nto the accuser to mass his facts together and to the\ndefence to separate them. I used also, with reference to the whole material\nof the case, to do what I have already mentioned\nas being done with arguments, namely, after first setting forth all the facts without exception, I then\ndisposed of all of them with the one exception\nof the fact which I wished to be believed. For\nexample, in charges of collusion it may be argued\nas follows. If I could not\ndispose of all the points against me, I disposed of\nthe majority. The task not\nmerely of division, but of invention as well, is rendered materially easier by this method of examining\nall possible arguments and arriving at the best by a\nprocess of elimination. Milo is accused of killing\nClodius. Either he did or did not do the deed.\nThe best policy would be to deny the fact, but that\nis impossible. It is admitted then that he killed\nhim. The act must then have been either right or\nwrong. We urge that it was right. If so, the act\nmust have either been deliberate or under compulsion of necessity, for it is impossible to plead\nignorance. The intention is doubtful, but as it is\ngenerally supposed to have existed, some attempt\nmust he made to defend it and to show that it was\nfor the good of the state. On the other hand, if we\nplead necessity, we shall argue that the fight was\naccidental and unpremeditated. One of the two\nparties then must have lain in wait for the other.\nWhich was it Clodius without doubt. Do you\nsee how inevitably we are led to the right method\nof defence by the logical necessity of the facts We\nmay carry the process further either he wished to\nkill Clodius, who lay in wait for him, or he did not.\nThe safer course is to argue that he did not wish\nto kill him. It was then the slaves of Milo who did\nthe deed without Milo's orders or knowledge. But\nthis line of defence shows a lack of courage and\nlessens the weight of our argument that Clodius\nwas rightly killed. We shall therefore add the\nwords, This method is\nall the more useful from the fact that often we can\nfind nothing to say that really pleases us and yet\nhave got to say something. Let us therefore consider every possible point; for thus we shall discover what is the best line for us to pursue, or at\nany rate what is least bad. Sometimes, as I have\nalready said in the appropriate context, we may\nmake good use of the statement of our opponent,\nsince occasionally it is equally to the purpose of\nboth parties. I am aware that some authors have written\nthousands of lines to show how we may discover\nwhich party ought to speak first. But in the actual practice of the courts this is decided either by some\nbrutally rigid formula, or by the character of the\nsuit, or finally by lot. In the schools, on the other\nhand, such an enquiry is mere waste of time, since\nthe prosecution and the defence are indifferently\npermitted to state a case and refute it in the same\ndeclamation. But in the majority of controversial\nthemes it is not even possible to discover who\nshould speak first, as for instance in the following The sons dispute the point.\nIt is uncertain who should speak first, but our\ncourse is clear enough. For we shall begin with the\nson whose role we assume. So much for the general\nrules by which we should be guided in making our\ndivision. But how shall we discover those questions which\npresent abnormal difficulty Just as we discover\nreflexions, words, figures or the appropriate nuances\nof style, namely by native wit, by study and by\npractice. None the less it will be rare for anyone\nwho is not a fool to fail to discover them, so long as\nhe is content, as I have said, to accept nature for a\nguide. Many, however, in their passionate desire to\nwin a reputation for eloquence are content to produce\nshowy passages which contribute nothing to the\nproof of their case, while others think that their\nenquiry need not proceed further than that which\nmeets the eye. To make my meaning clearer, I will cite a solitary example from the controversial themes of\nthe schools; it is neither novel nor complicated. In this case those paragons of eloquence,\nwho laugh at us because we trouble our heads about\ncases that rarely occur, will always assume the\npopular rle. They will defend the uneducated\nagainst the eloquent son, the brave against the\ncoward, the son who secured the recall of his kin\nagainst the ungrateful son, the son who is content\nwith a portion of the inheritance against the son\nwho would refuse his brother a share in their\npatrimony. All these points are actually to be\nfound in the case and are of considerable importance, but they are not such as to render victory\na certainty. In such a case they will, as far as\npossible, search for daring or obscure reflexions for\nto-day obscurity is accounted a virtue, and they\nwill think they have given the theme a brilliant\ntreatment by ranting and raving over it. Those, on\nthe other hand, whose ideals are higher, but who\nrestrict themselves merely to the obvious, will note the following points, which are, however, purely\nsuperficial. The uneducated son may be excused\nfor not appearing at the trial on the ground that he\ncould contribute nothing to his father's defence but\neven the orator has no claim on the gratitude of\nthe accused, since the latter was condemned the\nman who secured the recall of his kin deserves\nto receive the inheritance, while the man who\nrefuses to divide it with his brother, more especially with a brother who has deserved so well\nof him, is avaricious, unnatural and ungrateful\nthey will further note that the first and essential\nquestion is that which turns on the letter and intention of the law; unless this is first disposed of,\nall subsequent arguments must fall to the ground.\nHe, however, who follows the guidance of nature\nwill assuredly reflect as follows the first argument\nof the uneducated son will be, Who is so ignorant or so lacking in education as\nnot to make this his opening, even though he\ndoes not know what is meant by a proposition\nHe will then proceed to extol, though with due\nmoderation, the justice of this common law of\nnations. The next point for our consideration is\nwhat reply can be made to so equitable a demand\nThe answer is clear This statement will be\nfollowed by the necessary praise of the law and\ndenunciation of the man who failed to appear. So far we have been dealing entirely with admitted facts. Let us now return to the claimant.\nUnless he is hopelessly unintelligent, surely the\nfollowing argument will suggest itself What then shall we say But if the law applies to all men, it\nwill be of no avail to plead lack of education. We\nmust therefore try to discover whether there be not\nsome point on which the law can be invalidated.\nWe turn for guidance to nature a point on which\nI cannot insist too often; what does she suggest\nsave that when the letter of the law is against us,\nwe should discuss its intention This introduces\nthe general question whether we are to stand by the\nletter or the spirit. But if we argue this question\non general grounds with reference to law in the\nabstract, we shall go on for ever; it is a question\nthat has never been decided. We must therefore\nrestrict our enquiry to the particular law on which\nour case turns and try to find some argument\nagainst adhesion to the strict letter. Well, then, is\neveryone who fails to appear in defence of his father\nto be disinherited Are there no exceptions to the\nrule At this point the following arguments will\nspontaneously suggest themselves. For we may imagine a case\nwhere the son is an infant and has failed to appear\nin his father's support. Again We have\ngained a considerable amount of ground; for we have established the fact that a man may fail to\nappear for his father and still inherit. Our declaimer,\nwho has thought out this line of argument, must now\npass over like a Latin flute-player, as Cicero says,\nto the side of the eloquent son and reply, Is there any\nanswer to this except the previous reply,  But to this there is the obvious\nretort, which is no more than the simple truth. The uneducated son must therefore return to the intention\nof the legislator. To this the\neloquent son will reply, The uneducated son\nreplies, These arguments are based\non conjecture, as also will be the excuse put forward\nby the uneducated son to the effect that his father\nadvised his absence, as he did not wish to emperil\nhis whole family. All these arguments are involved\nin the preliminary question as to the letter and the\nintention of the law. Let us pursue the matter\nfurther and see if we can discover any additional\narguments. How is that to be done I am deliberately imitating the actual train of thought of one who is engaged in such an enquiry with a view to\nshowing how such enquiry should be conducted. I\nshall therefore put aside the more showy kind of\ncomposition, and concern myself solely with such as\nmay be of real profit to the student. So far we have derived all our questions from the\ncharacter of the claimant. But why should we not\nmake some enquiries into the character of the father\nDoes not the law say that whoever fails to appear\nfor his father is to be disinherited Why should we\nnot try asking whether this means that he is to be\ndisinherited, whatever the character of the father\nfor whom he failed to appear Such a course is\noften adopted in those controversial themes in\nwhich we demand that sons who fail to maintain\ntheir parents should be cast into prison take for\nexample the case of the mother who gave evidence\nagainst her son when accused of being an alien, or\nof the father who sold his son to a procurer. What,\nthen, is there in the present case that we lay hold of\nas regards the character of the father He was\ncondemned. But does the law apply only to those\ncases where the father is acquitted At first sight\nthe question is difficult. But let us not despair. It\nis probable that the intention of the legislator was\nthat innocent parents should secure the support of\ntheir children. But the uneducated son will be\nashamed to produce this argument, since he acknowledges that his father was innocent. There is, however, another line of argument which may be drawn\nfrom the enactment that the person condemned for\ntreason should be banished together with his\nadvocate. It seems almost impossible that in one\nand the same case a son should incur a penalty, both if he appeared in his father's defence and if\nhe did not appear. Further, exiles are outlaws.\nTherefore the letter of the law cannot conceivably apply to the advocate of the condemned\nman. For how can an exile hold any property\nThe uneducated son raises a doubt as to the interpretation both of the letter and the spirit of the law.\nTile eloquent son will cling to the strict letter of\ntile law, which makes no exception, and will argue\nthat the reason for enacting a penalty against those\nwho fail to appear for their fathers was to prevent\ntheir being deterred from the defence of their\nfathers by the risk of banishment, and he will assert\nthat his brother failed to appear in defence of\nhis innocent father. It may therefore be worth\nwhile pointing out that two general questions may\narise out of one basis for we may ask, or So far all our questions have been derived from\ntwo of the persons involved. With regard to the\nthird, this can give rise to no question, as there is\nno dispute about his portion of the inheritance.\nStill the time is not yet come to relax our\nefforts for so far all the arguments might have\nbeen used even if the father had not been recalled\nfrom exile. But we must not betake ourselves\nat once to the obvious point that he was recalled\nby the agency of the uneducated son. A little\ningenuity will lead us to look further a field\nfor as species comes after genus, so genus precedes\nspecies. Let us therefore assume that the father\nwas recalled by someone else. This will give rise to a question of the ratiocinative or syllogistic type,\nnamely whether recall from exile cancels the sentence of the court and is tantamount to the trial\nnever having taken place at all. The uneducated\nson will therefore attempt to argue that, being\nentitled to not more than one reward, there was no\nmeans by which he could have secured the recall of\nhis kin save by the restoration of his father on the\nsame terms as if he had never been accused, and\nthat this fact carries with it the cancellation of the\npenalty incurred by his advocate, as though he had\nnever defended his father at all. Our next point\nwill be that which first occurred to us, namely the\nplea that he was recalled by the agency of the\nuneducated son. At this point we are confronted\nby the question whether the son who secured his\nfather's restoration is thereby to be regarded in the\nlight of an advocate, since he secured for him\nprecisely what his original advocate demanded for\nhim, and it is not an unreasonable claim to ask that\nan action should be regarded as equivalent when it\nis really more than equivalent. The remaining\npoints turn on questions of equity, for we ask which\nof the two sons makes the juster claim. This\nquestion admits of still further division. The claim\nof the uneducated son would have been the juster\neven if both had claimed the whole property. How\nmuch more so when one claims only a half and the\nother the whole to the exclusion of his brother.\nAnd then, even after we have dealt with all these\npoints, an appeal to the memory of his father will\ncarry great weight with the judges, more especially\nas the dispute is about the father's estate. This\nwill give rise to conjecture as to what the intentions of the father were at the time of his dying intestate.\nThis conjecture, however, involves a question of\nquality, and is employed in the service of a\ndifferent basis. As a rule questions of equity are\nbest introduced at the conclusion of a case, since\nthere is nothing to which the judges give more\nready hearing. Sometimes, however, the interests\nof the case demand a change in this order; for\nexample if we regard our case as weak in point of\nlaw, it will be well to secure the good-will of the\njudge by dealing with the question of equity first. This concludes my general rules on this subject.\nWe will now proceed to consider the several parts\nof forensic cases, and although I cannot follow them\nto the ultimate species, that is to say, I cannot deal\nwith individual suits and controversies, I shall be\nable to discuss them on general lines in such a way\nas to show what bases most of them involve. And\nsince the first question naturally is whether an\nalleged fact has taken place, I will begin with this. All conjecture is concerned either with facts\nor intention. Each of these may occur in one of\nthree times, past, present or future. Questions\nconcerning facts are either general or definite, that\nis to say, those which involve consideration of\npersons and those which do not. Concerning intentions there can be no questions which do not\ninvolve some person and where the facts of the\ncase are not admitted. Therefore when the question\nturns on some fact, the point on which doubt arises\nis either what has been done, or what is being done,\nor what is likely to be done. For example, in general\nquestions we discuss whether the universe has been\nformed of a concourse of atoms, or is governed by providence, or is likely some day to come to an end.\nIn definite questions, on the other hand, we discuss whether Roscius has murdered his father,\nwhether Manlius is aiming at making himself king,\nor Quintus Caecilius will be justified in appearing\nas the accuser of Verres. In the law courts past\ntime is of most importance, since all accusations\nare concerned with what has actually been done,\nwhile what is being done or is likely to be done is\ninferred from the past. We also enquire into origins.\nFor instance, we enquire whether a pestilence be\ndue to the anger of heaven, the inclement weather,\nthe pollution of the water-supply, or the noxious\nvapours emitted by the earth. Again, we seek for\nthe motives of an act. For example, we enquire\nwhether the fifty kings who sailed against Troy did\nso because they were bound by their oath, or were\nmoved to do so by righteous indignation, or merely\ndesired to gratify the sons of Atreus. There is no\nvery great difference between these two classes of\nquestion. As regards facts falling within the present,\nif they can be detected by the eye without any\nreference to their logical antecedents being required,\nthere will be no need of conjecture let us suppose,\nfor instance, that the Lacedaemonians are enquiring\nwhether the Athenians are erecting fortifications.\nBut although conjecture may seem entirely foreign\nto this class of question, there are cases in which it\nit necessary, as in questions of personal identity,\nwhich may be illustrated by the action brought\nagainst the heirs of Urbinia, where the question\nwas whether the man who claimed the property as\nbeing the son of the deceased, was Figulus or Sosipater. In this case the actual person was before the eyes of the court, so that there could be no question\nwhether he existed as there is, for instance, when\nwe ask whether there exists any land beyond the\nOcean nor what he was nor of what kind. The\nquestion was simply, who he was. But this kind of\ndispute also depends on past time. The problem is\nwhether this man Clusinius Figulus was born of\nUrbinia. Such disputes have arisen even in our\nown day, indeed I myself have pleaded in such.\nOn the other hand, conjecture as to intention is\nobviously concerned with all three times. We ask\nwith what purpose Ligarius went to Africa, with\nwhat purpose Pyrrhus is asking for a treaty, and\nhow Caesar will take it if Ptolemy kills Pompey. We may also employ conjecture to enquire into\nquality in questions dealing with size, species and\nnumber, such as whether the sun is greater than the\nearth, whether the moon is spherical, flat or conical,\nwhether there is one universe or several, or, to go\noutside these physical speculations, whether the\nTrojan or the Peloponnesian war was the greatest,\nwhat was the nature of the shield of Achilles, or\nwhether there was more than one Hercules. In forensic cases, however, which consist of\naccusation and defence, there is one kind of conjecture by which we enquire both about an act\nand about its author. This sometimes treats the two\nquestions together, as, for example, when both the\nact and the identity of the author are denied, and\nsometimes separately, as when the first enquiry,\nwhether the act was committed, is followed by a\nsecond, where, the act being admitted, the question\nis by whom it was committed. The act itself again\nsometimes involves a single question, as, for example, whether a man is dead, and sometimes two, as, for\ninstance, whether he died of poison or of some internal\ndisease. Another form of conjecture is concerned\nwith the act alone, it being admitted that if the\nact was really committed, there can be no doubt as\nto its author. A third form is concerned solely with\nthe author, the act being admitted and the dispute\nturning on the question as to who committed it.\nThis third form is complex. For the accused either\nconfines himself to denying that he did it or accuses\nanother of having done it. Further, there is more\nthan one way of transferring the charge to another.\nAt times this results in mutual accusation, which the\nGreeks call and some of our own authors\nconcertative accusation. At times, on the other hand,\nthe charge is transferred to some person who\ncannot be brought to trial, and may be either\nknown or unknown again, if the person is known,\nhe may be someone outside the case or the victim\nhimself, who may be alleged to have committed\nsuicide. In such cases we compare characters,\nmotives and other circumstances in the same way\nas in eases of mutual accusation. Cicero, for instance,\nin the pro Vareno diverts the charge from the\naccused to the slaves of Ancharius and in the pro\nScauro throws the suspicion of Bostar's murder upon\nhis mother. There is also a different form of comparison, which comes into play when both parties\nclaim the credit of some act, and yet another kind,\nwhen the question is not as between two persons,\nbut as between two acts; that is to say, the\nquestion is not which of the two committed an act,\nbut which of two acts was committed. Finally,\nif the act and the identity of the author are both admitted, we may still raise the question of his\nintention. I shall now proceed to detail. As an example of\njoint denial covering both the act and the identity\nof the author we may take the following statements, In cases of\nmurder or poisoning the denial is often divided as\nfollows But if the\ndefence say, the\nburden falls solely on the accuser, for the accused can\nsay nothing more against the charge except perhaps\nin the way of casting certain suspicions, which he\nshould throw out in the vaguest terms, since if you\nmake one definite assertion, you will have to prove it\nor run the risk of losing your case. For when the\nquestion lies between our statement and that of our\nopponent, one or other will be regarded as true.\nThus when the point on which we relied for our\ndefence is overthrown, there is nothing left but the\npoints that tell against us. For example, when the\nquestion turns on symptoms, which may point either\nto poisoning or internal disease, there is no third\ncourse left open and consequently each party sticks\nto his statement. At times the question turns on\nthe nature of the fact, whether, for instance, death\nwas due to poisoning or internal disease, and arguments are introduced which are drawn from the\ncircumstances alone without any reference to the\nperson concerned. For example, it makes a difference whether the deceased was cheerful or depressed,\nhad been working or taking his ease, had been awake\nor sleeping previous to the festive gathering that was followed by his death. The age of the deceased\nis also an important factor, and it is desirable to\nknow whether he died suddenly or after a long\nperiod of ill health. If the question turns only on\nhis sudden death, both parties will have still freer\nscope for discussion. At times the character of the\naccused may be adduced to prove the fact, and to\nmake it likely that it was or was not a case of\npoisoning because the accused is or is not a likely\nperson to have committed such an act. When, on the other hand, the enquiry concerns\nboth the accused and the act, the natural order for\nthe accuser to pursue is to commence by proving\nthat the act has been committed and then to go on\nto show that it was committed by the accused. If,\nhowever, proofs of the authorship of the crime are\nmore in number than the proofs of the commission,\nthis order may be reversed. On the other hand, the\naccused will always begin by denying the act, since\nif this can be successfully proved, there is no need\nto say anything more, while if it is not proved, there\nremain other means of defence. Similarly, when the dispute turns solely on the act\nand, the act being proved, there can be no doubt as\nto the author, arguments may be drawn in like\nmanner both from the person and the facts, although\nwith reference to the question of fact alone. Take the\nfollowing controversial theme as an example, for it\nis best to employ scholastic themes as illustrations\nsince they are more familiar to the student. There is no doubt\nwho administered the draught, and, if it was poison,\nthere is no question as to the author but the\nproblem as to whether the draught was poison can\nonly be decided by arguments drawn from the\ncharacter of the accused. There remains a third type of conjectural case\nwhere the fact is admitted, and the only question\nis as to the author. It is unnecessary for me to\nquote examples, since such cases are of frequent\noccurrence. For example, it may be clear that a\nman has been killed or that sacrilege has been committed, but the person accused of the crime may\ndeny his guilt. It is from such circumstances that\ncases of mutual accusation arise, where it is admitted\nthat the crime has been committed, but each party\ncharges the other with being the author. With regard to this class of case Celsus points out that they\ncannot actually occur in the courts, a fact which I\nimagine is familiar to all for the jury is empanelled\nto try one accused person only, and even though\nthe defence and the prosecution may accuse each\nother of tile crime, the first case must be tried before\nthe second. Apollodorus again stated that mutual\naccusation involved two separate disputes, and this\nis of course in conformity with the practice of the\ncourts, which insists on two separate trials. On the\nother hand, mutual accusation is possible in cases\ntried before the senate or the emperor, and even in\nthe courts the fact of mutual accusation will involve no difference in the pleadings, since the same\nmethods will be required whether the verdict is\ngiven on both charges simultaneously or only on\none. In such cases the defence must always come\nfirst for three reasons. In the first place, we naturally prefer to secure our own safety than to injure\nour opponent, while secondly, our accusation will\ncarry greater weight if we have first proved our\nown innocence, and thirdly, we shall thus secure\na double line of defence. For the man who says, is then free to go on to say, whereas it is superfluous for the\nman who says, to go on to say, Further, such cases consist of comparison, which\nmay be effected in different ways. For we may either\ncompare our case in its entirety with that of our\nadversary, or we may compare individual arguments.\nThe choice between these two methods can only\nbe determined by the requirements of the case. For\nexample, in the pro Vareno, Cicero, in dealing with\nthe first charge, compares the individual arguments\nfor it would have been rash in connexion with the\nsecond charge to compare the position of a stranger\nwith that of a mother. It is therefore best, if\npossible, to refute argument by individual argument\nif, however, our individual arguments are weak, we\nshall try to secure success by comparison of case\nwith case as a whole. But whether the case is\none of mutual accusation, or the accused throws\nthe guilt upon his opponent without making any\nformal accusation as Roscius did without indicting his accusers, or the responsibility for the deed be\nplaced on the victims themselves, whom we allege\nto have perished by their own hand, the arguments\nfor both sides of the case will be compared in\nexactly the same way as in cases of mutual accusation. The class of case last mentioned by me is,\nhowever, not merely of frequent occurrence in\nthe schools, but sometimes actually occurs in the\ncourts. For example, the sole question in the\ncase of Naevius of Arpinum was whether he threw\nhis wife out of the window or she threw herself.\nMy speech in this case is the only one of all my\npleadings that I have so far published, and I admit\nthat I was led to do so merely by a youthful\ndesire for glory. For the other speeches which\ncirculate as mine have little in them that actually\nfell from my lips, having been corrupted by the\ncarelessness of the shorthand-writers who took\nthem down with a view to making money out of\nthem. There is also another type of conjectural case\nwhich, though it involves two questions, is different\nfrom cases of mutual accusation; such cases are concerned with rewards and may be illustrated by the\nfollowing controversial theme. Now just as in cases of mutual accusation where each\nparty shifts the guilt to his opponent, so in this case we compare the characters, motives, means,\nopportunities, instruments and evidence of the\npersons who claim the reward. There is yet another\ntype of case which, though not one of mutual\naccusation, is treated in the same way I mean a\ncase in which we enquire, without accusing anyone, which of two acts has taken place. For both\nparties make and defend their own statement of\nthe case. Thus in the suit concerning the estate\nof Urbinia the claimant says that Clusinius Figulus,\nthe son of Urbinia, on the defeat of the army\nin which he was serving, fled and after various\nmisfortunes, being even even kept in captivity by\nthe king, at length returned to Italy and his own\nhome in the Marrucine district, where he was recognised. To this Pollio replies that he had been a\nslave to two masters at Pisaurum, that he had\npractised medicine, and finally, after receiving his\nfreedom, inserted himself into a gang of slaves who\nwere for sale and was at his own request purchased by himself. Does not the whole suit consist\nof comparison between the two cases and of two\ndifferent and opposite sets of conjecture But the\nmethod to be followed is identical whether the case\nbe one of accusation and defence or of claim and\ndenial of the claim. Conjecture is, in the first place, based on what is\npast, under which I include persons, causes and\nintent. For in dealing with a case we first ask\nwhat the accused intended to do, next what he was\nin a position to do, and lastly what he actually did.\nConsequently the first point on which we must fix\nour attention is the character of the accused. It is\nthe business of the accuser to make any charge that he may bring against the accused not merely discreditable, but as consistent as possible with the\ncrime for which he is arraigned. For example, if\nhe calls a man accused of murder a debauchee or\nan adulterer, the discredit attaching to such charges\nwill no doubt tell against the accused, but will, on\nthe other hand, do less to prove the case than if\nhe shows him to be bold, insolent, cruel or reckless.\nOn the other hand, counsel for the defence must,\nas far as possible, aim at denying, excusing or\nextenuating such charges, or, if that be impossible,\nshow that they are not relevant to the case. For\nthere are many charges which not only have no\nmutual resemblance, but may even at times contradict each other, as for instance if a man accused\nof theft is called prodigal or careless. For it is\nnot likely that one and the same man should at\nonce despise money and covet it. If such means\nof defence are not available, we must take refuge\nwith the plea that the charges made are not\nrelevant to the case, that because a man has committed certain sins, it does not follow that he has\ncommitted all, and that the accusers ventured to\nmake such false charges merely because they hoped\nby injuring and insulting the accused to be able\nto overwhelm him with the unpopularity thus\ncreated. There are also other topics which arise\nfrom and against the statement of the case by the\nprosecution. The defence may begin by drawing\narguments from the person involved, and will at\ntimes urge on general grounds that it is incredible\nthat a father has been killed by his son or that a\ncommander has betrayed his country to the enemy.\nThe answer to such arguments is easy, for we may urge that bad men are capable of every crime, as\nis shown by every-day occurrences, or that the\natrocious nature of a crime is but a poor argument\nagainst its having been committed. At times we\nmay base our arguments on the special circumstances\nof the person involved. This may be done in various\nways rank, for example, may be pleaded in defence\nof the accused, or at times, on the other hand, may\nbe employed to prove his guilt on the ground that\nhe trusted to his rank to secure impunity. Similarly\npoverty, humble rank, wealth may be used as arguments for or against the accused according to the\ntalent of the advocate. Upright character, however,\nand the blamelessness of his past life are always of\nthe utmost assistance to the accused. If no charge\nis made against his character, counsel for the defence\nwill lay great stress on this fact, while the accuser\nwill attempt to restrict the judge to the sole consideration of the actual issue which the court has\nto decide, and will say that there must always be\na first step in crime and that a first offence is not\nto be regarded as the occasion for celebrating a\nfeast in honour of the defendant's character. So\nmuch for the methods of reply which will be employed by the prosecution. But he will also in his\nopening speech endeavour to dispose the judges to\nbelieve that it is not so much that he is unable,\nas that he is unwilling to bring any charge against\nthe character of the accused. Consequently it is\nbetter to abstain from casting any slur on the past\nlife of the accused than to attack him with slight\nor frivolous charges which are manifestly false,\nsince such a proceeding discredits the rest of\nour argument. Further, the advocate who brings no charges against the accused may be believed to\nhave omitted all reference to past offences on the\nground that such reference was not necessary, while\nthe advocate who heaps up baseless charges thereby\nadmits that his only argument is to be found in the\npast life of the accused, and that he has deliberately\npreferred to risk defeat on this point rather than\nsay nothing at all about it. As regards the other\narguments derived from character, I have already\ndiscussed them in connexion with of\nargument. The next type of proof is derived from causes or\nmotives, such as anger, hatred, fear, greed or hope,\nsince all motives can be classified as species of one\nor other of these. If any of these motives can be\nplausibly alleged against the accused, it is the duty\nof the accuser to make it appear that such motives\nmay lead a man to commit any crime, and to exaggerate the particular motives which he selects for\nthe purpose of his argument. If no such motive can\nbe alleged, he must take refuge in suggesting that\nthere must have been some hidden motive, or in\nasserting that, if he committed the act, all enquiry\ninto motive is irrelevant or that a motiveless crime\nis even more abominable than one which has a\nmotive. Counsel for the defence, on the other hand,\nwill, wherever it be possible, emphasise the point\nthat it is incredible that any act should be committed\nwithout a motive. Cicero develops this point with\ngreat energy in a number of his speeches, but more\nespecially in his defence of Varenus, who had everything else against him and was as a matter of fact\ncondemned. But if the prosecution do allege some\nmotive, he will either say that the motive alleged is false or inadequate or unknown to the accused. For\nit is possible that a man may be quite ignorant of\nmotives imputed to him. He may not, for example,\nhave known whether the man whom he is accused\nof having killed had appointed him his heir\nor intended to prosecute him. All else failing,\nwe may urge that motives are not necessarily of\nimportance. For what man is there who is not\nliable to the emotions of fear, hatred or hope, and\nyet numbers of persons act on these motives without\ncommitting crime Nor should we neglect the point\nthat all motives do not apply to all persons. For\nexample, although poverty may in certain cases be a\nmotive for theft, it will not have the same force with\nmen such as Curius or Fabricius. The question has been raised as to whether we\nshould deal first with persons or motives, and different\norators have given different answers Cicero as a rule\nprefers to treat motives first. For my own part, if\nthe circumstances of the case do not point strongly\nin either direction, I consider that the most natural\ncourse is to begin by dealing with persons. For the\nenquiry whether any crime can credibly be imputed\nto such a man as the accused is of a more general\ncharacter than the question whether some one\nparticular crime can be imputed, and in addition\ninvolves a greater correctness in division. Still, in\nmany cases expediency may make it desirable to\nreverse the order. Further, we have to seek not\nmerely motives affecting the will, but also causes\nleading to error, such as drunkenness or ignorance.\nFor just as such considerations lessen the guilt of a\ncrime when regarded from the point of view of its\nquality, so they tell heavily against the criminal as far as the question of fact is concerned. I should\nimagine that there could never be a case, or at any rate\nan actual case in the courts, in which neither side said\nanything about the character of the persons involved;\nbut this is not true of causes and motives, for it is\noften wholly unnecessary to trouble ourselves about\nthem, as, for example, in cases of theft or adultery,\ncrimes which carry their motives on the face of them. Next we must consider the intention, a term which\ninvolves a number of questions, such as whether it is\nprobable that the accused hoped that he would be\nable to carry such a crime into effect, or that it\nwould escape detection when committed, or that,\neven if detected, it would be pardoned or punished\nbut lightly or after considerable lapse of time, or\nthat the inconvenience involved by the penalty\nwould be outweighed by the pleasure resulting from\nthe crime or again, whether it was worth while\nincurring the penalty; and further, whether he could\nhave done the deed at some other time and in some\nother way, or with greater ease or security, as Cicero\nsays in the pro Milone, where he mentions the\nnumerous occasions when his client could have killed\nClodius with impunity. There is also the question\nwhy the accused should have chosen that particular\nplace or time or means for the commission of the\ncrime, a topic to which Cicero gives a thorough\ntreatment in the same passage; or whether, without\nhaving the least reason for the deed, he was carried\naway by the impulse of the moment and acted\nwithout deliberate purpose for it is a common\nsaying that crimes are irrational, or finally, whether\nhe was led astray by the fact that crime had become\na habit with him. Having dealt with the question whether he\nintended to commit the crime, we proceed to the\nquestion whether he was in a position to commit it.\nUnder this head we discuss the place and occasion of\nthe offence. For instance, in a case of theft we ask\nwhether it was committed in a secluded or frequented\nspot, in the daytime, when witnesses are more\nnumerous, or by night, when success is more difficult.\nConsequently we shall consider all the circumstances\nrendering the act difficult or easy of accomplishment;\nthese require no illustration, being numerous and\nfamiliar. This second topic is of such importance\nthat, if it is impossible to give it satisfactory treatment, the case falls to the ground; if, however, we\nsucceed in dealing with it adequately, we must\nproceed to consider whether the accused actually\ncommitted the act. But this topic involves conjecture as to intention, for it is from these facts that\nwe infer whether he hoped for success or not.\nTherefore we must also consider the question of\nthe means at his disposal, such, for example, as the\nretinues of Clodius and Milo. The question whether he actually did the deed\nbelongs, in the first place, to the second division of\ntime, namely the present, and secondly to time that\nis almost, though not actually contemporary under\nthis latter head come circumstances such as noise,\ncries or groans, while concealment, fear and the\nlike belong to subsequent time. To these must be\nadded indications, which we have already discussed\nelsewhere, and words and acts antecedent or subsequent to the crime. These words and acts are either\nour own or those of others. With regard to words,\nour own do us greater harm and bring us less profit than do those of others, while those of others bring\nus greater profit and do us less harm than our own.\nOn the other hand, with regard to deeds, it is sometimes from our own and sometimes from those of\nothers that we derive the greatest advantage, as, for\nexample, when our opponent has done something\nwhich tells in our favour but our own acts are\nalways more injurious to our case than are those\nof others. Again, with regard to words, we must\ndistinguish between those whose meaning is clear\nand those whose significance is doubtful. The latter\nwill necessarily give less assistance to either side, be\nthey our own words or another's. On the other hand,\nany ambiguity in our own words will always tell\nagainst us, as, for example, in the following controversial theme. When the ambiguity lies in words used by\nothers, they can never do us any harm, unless he\nwho uttered them be unknown or dead; I will give\ntwo illustrations of my meaning and, For if the speaker is available for\nexamination, he will clear up the ambiguity. Finally,\nwhereas our own words and deeds can only be justified by their intention, the deeds and words of others\ncan be disposed of in a number of different ways. My remarks on this subject have, I think, been\nconfined to one very important class of conjectural\ncases, but something of what I have said will apply\nto all cases. For example, in cases concerned with theft, deposits and loans, arguments are derived both\nfrom possibilities as when we enquire whether there\nwas any money to deposit, and from persons, as when\nwe raise the question whether it is credible that anyone deposited money with this man or trusted him\nwith a loan, or that the claimant is bringing a false\naccusation, or that the accused repudiates his debt or\nis a thief. But even in the case of an accusation of\ntheft, just as in an accusation of murder, we enquire\nboth into the act and the author, while in cases\nconcerned with loans and deposits there are also\ntwo questions though these are always distinct\nfrom one another, namely, whether the money was\ndelivered and whether it has been repaid. Cases of\nadultery are marked by the following peculiarity,\nthat, as a rule, the safety of two persons is involved,\nand it is necessary to say something of the past life\nof both, although some have raised the question\nwhether both parties should be defended together.\nThe line to be taken must depend on the circumstances of the individual case if the defence of one\nparty lends support to the defence of the other, I\nshould defend them conjointly; if the reverse is the\ncase, I should treat the two cases separately. However, that no one may think me somewhat hasty in\nsaying that two persons are as a rule involved in\ncharges of adultery, I would point out that I would\nnot assert that this is always the case. The\nwoman alone may be accused of adultery with a\nperson unknown we may say, The case is similar in accusations of\nforgery for either there are several accused or only one. The writer of a document always regards it as\nnecessary to support the signatory, but the signatory\ndoes not always support the writer of the document,\nfor it is always possible that he has been deceived\non the matter. On the other hand, the man who is\nsaid to have called in their services, and for whom\nthe document is alleged to have been written, will\nalways defend both writer and signatories. The\narguments employed in cases of treason or attempted\ntyranny will be drawn from the same sources. But the custom prevalent in the schools of regarding everything not definitely stated in the theme as\nbeing in the speaker's favour, is likely to prove\nharmful to students destined for practice in the\ncourts. You bring a charge of adultery. You charge\nme with treason. You charge me with poisoning. Or in defence of\none charged with attempting to establish himself as\ntyrant, the declaimer will cry, I do not deny that these questions\nshould be asked, or that we should use them as\nfar as is permitted by the rle which we have\nassumed; for even in the courts I feel that it will\nbe desirable to put such questions, if my opponent\nis not in a position to reply effectively; but we have\noften felt the lack of such freedom in the courts,\nwhereas in the schools there is scarcely a case where\none or more examples of this method are not to be\nfound. Similar to this is the practice which some declaimers allow themselves in their perorations\nof assigning children, parents and nurses to their\ncharacters at will, though it is more reasonable to\ncall for evidence which is not explicitly mentioned\nin the statement of the theme than to introduce it\nourselves. With regard to the method to be followed when\nwe enquire into intention, I have said enough in\ndividing the subject into three questions, namely,\nwhether the accused intended to do the deed,\nwhether he was in a position to do it and whether\nhe actually did it. For the method of enquiring\ninto the purpose with which an act was committed\nis identical with that employed in enquiring whether\nthe deed was intended, since it amounts to asking\nwhether a criminal act was intended. Further, the\norder in which the facts are stated may either contribute to or detract from the credibility of our case;\nfor consistency and the reverse depend to a very\ngreat extent on the way the circumstances are\narranged. But we shall be unable to detect these\nqualities unless we consider the circumstances in\nconnexion with the case as a whole. None the less,\nit will always be necessary to consider what are best\nsuited to be placed together. III. Conjecture is followed by definition. For the\nman who cannot assert that he has done nothing,\nmust needs take refuge in the assertion that lie has\nnot committed the act which is alleged against him.\nConsequently the laws which govern definition are\nfor the most part the same as those which govern conjecture, the only difference lying in the method to be\nemployed in defence in cases such as those concerned\nwith theft, deposits or adultery. For just as we say, so we say, Sometimes we may pass from quality to\ndefinition, as in actions concerned with lunacy, cruelty\nand offences against the State. In such cases if it\nis impossible to assert that the acts alleged were\nright, we are left with such pleas as, Definition is the statement of the fact called in\nquestion in appropriate, clear and concise language.\nAs I have already said, it consists mainly in the\nstatement of genus, species, difference and property.\nFor example, if you wish to define a horse for I will\ntake a familiar example, the genus is animal, the\nspecies mortal, the diffrence irrational since man also\nis mortal and the properly neighing. Definition is\nemployed by the orator for a number of different\nreasons. For sometimes, though there may be no\ndoubt as to a term, there is a question as to what it\nincludes, or, on the other hand, there may be no\ndoubt about the thing, but no agreement as to the\nterm to be applied to it. When the term is agreed,\nbut the thing doubtful, conjecture may sometimes\ncome into play, as, for instance, in the question, For the man who denies that god\nis a spirit permeating all things, assuredly asserts\nthat the epithet is falsely applied to his\nnature, like Epicurus, who gives him a human form\nand makes him reside in the intermundane space.\nWhile both use the same term god, both have to employ conjecture to decide which of the two meanings\nis consistent with fact. Sometimes again we have\nrecourse to quality, as in the question, This form of question is of\nfrequent occurrence in the courts. For instance, the\nquestion may arise whether a man caught in a\nbrothel with another man's wife is an adulterer.\nHere there is no doubt about the name; it is the\nsignificance of the act which is in doubt, since the\nquestion is whether he has committed any sin at all.\nFor if he has sinned, his sin can only be adultery.\nThere is a different type of question where the\ndispute is concerned with the term to be applied,\nwhich depends on the letter of the law it is a form\nof question which can only arise in the courts from\nthe actual words on which the dispute turns. Take\nas examples the questions, whether suicide is a form\nof homicide, or whether the man who forces a tyrant\nto kill himself can be considered a tyrannicide, or\nwhether magical incantations are equivalent to the\ncrime of poisoning. In all these cases there is no\ndoubt about the facts, for it is well known that there\nis a difference between killing oneself and killing\nanother, between slaying a tyrant and forcing him\nto suicide, between employing incantations and\nadministering a deadly draught, but we enquire\nwhether we are justified in calling them by the\nsame name. Though I hardly like to differ from Cicero, who\nfollows many authorities in saying that definition is\nconcerned with identity and difference since he\nwho denies the applicability of one term must always\nproduce another term which he regards as preferable, for my own part I consider that definition\nfalls into three types, which I may perhaps call\nspecies. For at times it is convenient merely to enquire whether one particular term is applicable to\na given thing, as in the question whether an act\ncommitted in a brothel is adultery. If we deny\nthat it is adultery, there is no need to state what it\nshould be called, since we have given a total denial\nto the charge. Secondly, there are occasions when\nthe question is which of two terms is to be applied\nto a thing, as in the question whether an act is\ntheft or sacrilege. It may be sufficient for the\ndefence that it is not sacrilege, but it is still necessary\nto show what else it is, and therefore we must define\nboth. Thirdly, there are times when the question\nconcerns things which are different in species, and\nwe ask whether two different things are to be called\nby the same name, in spite of the fact that each has\na special name of its own for example, is tile same\nname applicable both to a love-potion and a poison\nBut in all disputes of this kind the question is\nwhether one thing is another thing as well, since\nthe name in doubt does without question apply to\nsomething else. It is sacrilege to steal a sacred\nobject from a temple; is it also sacrilege to steal\nprivate property from a temple It is adultery to\nlie with another man's wile in one's own house; is\nit adultery to do so in a brothel It is tyrannicide\nto slay a tyrant; is it tyrannicide to force him to\nslay himself Consequently the syllogism, to which\nI shall return later, is virtually a weaker form of\ndefinition, since while definition seeks to determine\nwhether one thing has the same name as another,\nsyllogism seeks to determine whether one thing is\nto be regarded as identical with another. There is\nmoreover great variety in definitions. For instance,\npersons will give different verbal expression to things about which they are really in agreement\nthus rhetoric is defined as the science of speaking\nwell, as the science of correct conception or correct\nexpression of what we have to say, as the science of\nspeading in accordance with the excellence of an orator\nand again of speaking to the purpose. And we must\ntake care to discover how it is that definitions,\nidentical in meaning, differ in the form in which\nthey are expressed. However, this is a subject for\ndiscussion and not for a quarrel. Definition is sometimes required to explain rare or obscure words such\nas clarigatio or erctum citum, or again to explain\nfamiliar words such as penus or litus. This variety in definition has caused some writers\nto include it under conjecture, others under quality\nand others again under legal questions. Some, on\nthe other hand, entirely reject the elaborate and\nformal methods of reasoning employed by dialectic,\nregarding such ingenuity as suited rather to quibbles\nover words in philosophical discussions than as likely\nto carry much weight in the performance of the\nduties of an orator. For though in dialogue definition may serve to fetter the person who has got\nto reply in chains of his own making, or may force\nhim to silence, or even to reluctant confession of a\npoint which tells against himself, it is of less use in\nforensic cases. For there we have to persuade the\njudge, who, even though he may be tied and bound\nwith our words, will still dissent in silence, unless he\nis brought really into touch with the actual facts.\nAnd what need has a pleader for such precision of\ndefinition Even if I do not say that man is an\nanimal, mortal and rational, surely I shall still be\nable, by setting forth the numerous properties of his body and mind in more general terms, to distinguish\nhim from gods or dumb beasts. Again, may not the\nsame thing be defined in more than one way, as\nCicero does when he says, May it not be given a wide and varied treatment\nsuch as is frequently employed by all orators For\nit is rare to find orators falling victims to that form\nof slavery introduced from the practice of the philosophers and tying themselves down to certain\ndefinite words; indeed it is absolutely forbidden by\nMarcus Antonius in the de Oratore of Cicero.\nFor it is a most dangerous practice, since, if we make\na mistake in a single word, we are like to lose our\nwhole case, and consequently the compromise adopted\nby Cicero in the pro Caecina is the safest course to\nfollow; this consists in setting forth the facts without\nrunning any risks over the exactness of our terminology. These are his words Or again, we may prove\nbefore we define, as Cicero does in the Philippics,\nwhere he proves that Servius Sulpicius was killed by\nAntony and introduces his definition at the conclusion in the following terms\nI would not, however, deny that such rules should be\nemployed, if it will help our case, and that, if we\ncan produce a definition which is at once strong and\nconcise, it will be not merely an ornament to our\nspeech, but will also produce the strongest impression, provided always that it cannot be overthrown. The order to be followed in definition is invariable.\nWe first ask what a thing is, and then, whether it is\nthis. And there is generally more difficulty in the\nestablishment than in the application of a definition.\nIn determining what a thing is, there are two things\nwhich require to be done we must establish our\nown definition and destroy that of our opponent.\nConsequently in the schools, where we ourselves\nimagine our opponent's reply, we have to introduce\ntwo definitions, which should suit the respective\nsides of the case as well as it is in our power to\nmake them. But in the courts we must give careful\nconsideration to the question whether our definition\nmay not be superfluous and irrelevant or ambiguous\nor inconsistent or even of no less service to our\nopponents than to ourselves, since it will be the\nfault of the pleader if any of these errors occur. On\nthe other hand, we shall ensure the right definition,\nif we first make up our minds what it is precisely\nthat we desire to effect for, this done, we shall be\nable to suit our words to serve our purpose. To\nmake my meaning clearer, I will follow my usual\npractice and quote a familiar example. There is no doubt about his\nguilt; the question is whether the name given by\nthe law applies to the charge. It is therefore\ndebated whether the act constitutes sacrilege. The\naccuser employs this term on the ground that the\nmoney was stolen from a temple the accused denies\nthat the act is sacrilege, on the ground that the\nmoney stolen was private property, but admits that it is theft. The prosecutor will therefore give the\nfollowing definitions, The accused will reply\nwith another definition, Each impugns the other's definition. A definition may be overthrown on two\ngrounds it may be false or it may be too narrow.\nThere is indeed a possible third ground, namely\nirrelevance, but this is a fault which no one save a\nfool will commit. It is a false definition if you say, for though the horse\nis an animal, it is irrational. Again, a thing which\nis common to something else cannot be a property\nof the thing defined. In the case under discussion,\nthen, the accused alleges that the definition given\nby the accuser is false, whereas the accuser cannot\ndo the same by his opponent's definition, since to\nsteal a sacred object is undoubtedly sacrilege. He\ntherefore alleges that the definition is too narrow\nand requires the addition of the words But the most effective method of\nestablishing and refuting definitions is derived from\nthe examination of properties and differences, and\nsometimes even from considerations of etymology,\nwhile all these considerations will, like others, find\nfurther support in equity and occasionally in conjecture. Etymology is rarely of assistance, but the\nfollowing will provide an example of its use. Great\ningenuity may be exercised with regard to properties\nand differences, as for instance in the question\nwhether a person assigned to his creditor for debt, who is condemned by the law to remain in a state\nof servitude until he has paid his debt, is actually a\nslave. One party will advance the following definition, The other will produce the definition, This definition,\nthough it differs considerably from the other, will be\nquite useless unless it is supported by properties\nand differences. For the opponent will say that the\nperson in question is actually serving as a slave or is\nlegally in a state of servitude. We must therefore\nlook for properties and differences, to which in\npassing I devoted a brief discussion in my fifth book.\nA slave when manumitted becomes a freedman a\nman who is assigned for debt becomes a free man on\nthe restoration of his liberty. A slave cannot acquire\nhis freedom without the consent of his master a\nman assigned for debt can acquire it by paying his\ndebt without the consent of his master being\nnecessary. A slave is outside the law; a man\nassigned for debt is under the law. Turning to\nproperties, we may note the following which are\npossessed by none save the free, the three names\npraenomen, nomen and cognomen and membership\nof a tribe, all of which are possessed by the man\nassigned for debt. By settling what a thing is we have come near\nto determining its identity, for our purpose is to\nproduce a definition that is applicable to our case.\nNow the most important element in a definition is\nprovided by quality, as, for example, in the question\nwhether love be a form of madness. To this point in our procedure belong those proofs which according\nto Cicero are peculiar to definition, that is, proofs\ndrawn from antecedents, consequents, adjuncts, contraries, causes, effects and similarities, with the\nnature of which I have already dealt. I will, however, quote a passage from the pro Caecina in which\nCicero includes brief proofs drawn from origins,\ncauses, effects, antecedents and consequents But he also argued from similarity Arguments may\nalso be drawn from contraries, as for instance in the\nquestion whether a love-potion can be a poison, in\nview of the fact that a poison is not a love-potion. In order that my young students and I call them\nmine, because the young student is always dear to\nme may form a clearer conception of this second\nkind of definition, I will once more quote a fictitious\ncontroversial theme. The definition produced by the accuser\nwill run as follows The\ndefinition given by the accused will be, Without any formal definition it would be sufficient for\nthe accuser to argue as follows To which the accused might answer, Sometimes we have a settled definition on which\nboth parties are agreed, as in the following example\nfrom Cicero The\nquestion however, is, whether that majesty has been impaired, as for example in the ease of Cornelius.\nBut even although the case may seem to turn on\ndefinition, the point for decision is one of quality,\nsince there is no doubt about the definition, and\nmust be assigned to the qualitative basis. It is a\nmere accident that I have come to mention quality\nat this moment, but in point of fact quality is the\nmatter that comes next in order for discussion. IV. In speaking of quality we sometimes use\nthe word in its most general sense, which covers\na number of different questions. For we enquire\nsometimes into the nature and form of things as\nfor instance whether the soul is immortal or whether\ngod is to be conceived of in human form. Sometimes, on the other hand, the question turns on size\nand number, as, for instance, what is the size of\nthe sun or whether there are more worlds than\none. In all these cases we arrive at our conclusions\nby conjecture, yet each involves a question of quality.\nSuch questions are sometimes treated in deliberative themes for example, if Caesar is deliberating\nwhether to attack Britain, he must enquire into the\nnature of the Ocean, consider whether Britain is an\nisland a fact not then ascertained, and estimate its\nsize and the number of troops which lie will require\nfor the invasion. Under the same head of quality\nfall questions whether certain things should be done\nor not and certain objects sought or avoided such\ntopics are specially adapted for deliberative themes,\nbut occur with some frequency in controversial\nthemes as well, the only difference being that in\nthe latter we deal with what is past and in the\nformer with the future. Similarly all the topics\nof demonstrative oratory involve a qualitative basis. The facts are admitted, and the question turns on\ntheir quality, the dispute being entirely concerned\nwith rewards or penalties or their quantity. The\ncase is therefore of two kinds, simple or comparative, the former dealing with what is just, the latter\nwith what is juster, or most just. When the point\nfor decision is the penalty to be inflicted, the duty\nof the pleader will be to defend, extenuate or excuse\nthe act on which the charge is based, or even,\naccording to some, to plead for mercy. By far the strongest line that can be taken in\ndefence is to assert that the act which forms the\nsubject of the charge is actually honourable. A\nman is disinherited because he went on military\nservice, stood for office or married without his\nfather's consent. We defend this act. This form\nof defence is called by the followers of\nHermagoras, that is, defence by objection, the term\nbeing used with reference to the purport of the\ndefendant's plea. I can find no exact Latin translation of the term; we call it an absolute defence.\nBut in such cases the question is concerned with the\njustice or injustice of the act alone. Justice is\neither natural or conventional. Natural justice is\nfound in actions of inherent worth. Under this\nhead come the virtues of piety, loyalty, self-control\nand the like. To these some add the rendering\nof like for like. But this view must not be adopted\nwithout consideration for to retaliate, or meet\nviolence with violence on the one hand, does not\nimply injustice on the part of the aggressor, while\non the other hand it does not follow that the first\nact was just merely because the two acts were alike.\nIn cases where there is justice on both sides, the two parties must both come under the same law\nand the same conditions, and it would not perhaps\nbe untrue to say that things can never be spoken\nof as like if there is any point in which they\nare dissimilar. Convention, on the other hand, is\nto be found in laws, customs, legal precedents and\nagreements. There is another form of defence by which we\ndefend an act in itself indefensible by arguments\ndrawn from without. This the Greeks call by opposition. Here again there is no\nLatin equivalent, since we call it defence by assumption. The strongest line to take in this form\nof defence is to defend the act forming the subject\nof the charge by appealing to its motive. An\nexample of this is provided by the defence put\nforward on behalf of Orestes, Horatius or Milo. The\nterm or counter-accusation, is employed\nwhen our defence consists entirely in accusing the\nperson whom our opponents are seeking to vindicate. There is another form\nof defence based on an appeal to the motives of\nthe act which is the opposite of that which I have\njust described It consists not in defending the act\nper se, as we do when we employ the absolute\ndefence, nor in opposing another act to it, but\nin appealing to the interests of the State, of a\nnumber of persons, of our opponent himself or finally\nat times of ourselves, provided always that the act\nin question is such as we might lawfully do in our\nown interests. If, however, the accuser is a stranger\nand insists on the letter of the law, this form\nof defence will invariably be useless, though it may serve our turn if the dispute is of a domestic\ncharacter. For example, in a suit concerned\nwith the question of disinheritance a father may,\nwithout reflecting on himself, say to his sons that\nhis act was of importance to his own interests,\nand the same plea may be urged by a husband\naccused of cruelty by his wile or a son who\nalleges that his father is insane. But in such cases\nthe position of the man who seeks to avoid\nloss is stronger than that of him who aims at\npositive advantage. Precisely similar methods are\nalso employed in questions that occur in real life.\nFor the scholastic themes concerned with the disowning of children are on exactly the same footing\nas the cases of sons disinherited by their parents\nwhich are tried in the public courts, or of those\nclaims for the recovery of property which are tried\nin the centum viral court themes dealing with cruelty\nfind an actual parallel in those cases in which the\nwife claims the restoration of her dowry, and the\nquestion is whose fault it was that led to the divorce\nand again the theme where the son accuses his father\nof madness has its analogy in cases where a suit is\nbrought for the appointment of a guardian. Under\nthe same heading as the appeal to public or personal\ninterest comes the plea that the act in question\nprevented the occurrence of something worse. For\nin a comparison of evils the lesser evil must be\nregarded as a positive good for example, Mancinus\nmay defend the treaty made with the Numantines\non the ground that it saved the army from annihilation. This form of defence is called by\nthe Greeks, while we style it defence by comparison. Such are the methods by which we may defend an act. If it is impossible to defend an\nact either on its merits or with the assistance of\narguments from without, the next best course will\nbe to shift the charge, if possible, to another.\nIt is for this reason that the basis of competence has\nbeen held to apply even to those who cannot\nplead the letter of the law in this connexion. In\nsome cases, then, the blame will be thrown on a\nperson for example, Gracchus, when accused of\nmaking the treaty with the Numantines and it was\nfear of this accusation that seems to have led him\nto bring forward the democratic laws of his tribuneship may plead that he made it as the representative of his commander-in-chief. At times, on the\nother hand, the blame may be shifted to some\nthing for instance, a person who has failed to\ncomply with some testamentary injunction may plead\nthat the laws forbade such compliance. The Greek\nterm for such shifting is If these methods of defence are out of the\nquestion, we must take refuge in making excuses.\nWe may plead ignorance. For example, if a man\nhas branded a runaway slave and the latter is\nsubsequently adjudged to be a free man, he may\ndeny that he was cognisant of the truth. Or\nwe may plead necessity; for instance, if a soldier\noverstays his leave, he may plead that his return\nwas delayed by floods or ill health. Again, the\nblame is often cast upon fortune, while sometimes\nwe assert that, although we undoubtedly did wrong,\nwe did so with the best intentions. Instances\nof these two latter forms of excuse are, however,\nso numerous and obvious that there is no need for\nme to cite them here. If all the above-mentioned resources prove unavailable, we must see whether it may not be\npossible to extenuate the offence. It is here that\nwhat some call the quantitative basis comes into\nplay. But when quantity is considered in reference to punishment or reward, it is determined by\nthe quality of the act, and therefore in my opinion\ncomes under the qualitative basis, as also does quantity\nwhich is used with reference to number by the\nGreeks, who distinguish between and\n we, however, have only one name for\nthe two. In the last resort we may plead for mercy, a though\nmost writers deny that this is ever admissible in the\ncourts. Indeed Cicero himself seems to support\nthis view in his defence of Quintus Ligarius where\nhe says, and so on. On the other\nhand, in addressing the senate, the people, the emperor or any other authority who is in a position to\nshow clemency, such pleas for mercy have a legitimate\nplace. In such cases there are three points based\non the circumstances of the accused which are most\neffective. The first is drawn from his previous life, if\nhe has been blameless in his conduct and deserved\nwell of the state, or if there is good hope that his\nconduct will be blameless for the future and likely\nto be of some use to his fellow men; the second is\noperative if it appears that he has been sufficiently punished already on the ground that he has suffered\nother misfortunes, or that his present peril is extreme,\nor that he has repented of his sin; while thirdly we\nmay base his appeal on his external circumstances,\nhis birth, his rank, his connexions, his friendships. It is, however, on the judge that we shall pin our\nhighest hopes, if the circumstances be such that\nacquittal will result in giving him a reputation for\nclemency rather than for regrettable weakness. But\neven in the ordinary courts appeals for mercy are\nfrequently employed to a large extent, although they\nwill not colour the whole of our pleading. For the\nfollowing form of division is common a plea which has often\nturned the balance in doubtful cases, while practically\nall perorations contain such appeals. Sometimes\nindeed the whole case may rest on such considerations. For example, if a father has made an express\ndeclaration that he has disinherited his son because\nlie was in love with a woman of the town, will not\nthe whole question turn on the point whether it was\nthe father's duty to pardon such an offence and\nwhether it is the duty of the centumviral court\nto overlook it Nay, even in penal prosecutions\ngoverned by strict forms of law we raise two separate\nquestions first whether the penalty has been incurred,\nand secondly whether, if so, it ought to be inflicted.\nStill the view of the authorities to whom I have\nreferred that an accused person cannot be saved\nfrom the clutches of the law by this method of\ndefence is perfectly correct. With regard to rewards, there are two questions\nwhich confront us namely, whether the claimant is deserving of any reward, and, if so, whether he deserves so great a reward. If there are two claimants,\nwe have to decide which is the more worthy of the\ntwo; if there are a number, who is the most worthy.\nThe treatment of these questions turns on the kind\nof merit possessed by the claimants. And we must\nconsider not merely the act whether it has merely\nto be stated or has to be compared with the acts of\nothers, but the person of the claimant as well. For\nit makes a great difference whether a tyrannicide be\nyoung or old, man or woman, a stranger or a connexion. The place may also be discussed in a number\nof ways was the city in which the tyrant was killed\none inured to tyranny or one which had always been\nfree was he killed in the citadel or in his own\nhouse The means, too, and the time call for consideration was he killed by poison or the sword\nwas he killed in time of peace or war, when he was\nintending to lay aside his power or to venture on\nsome fresh crime Further, in considering the\nquestion of merit, the danger and difficulty of the act\nwill carry great weight, while with regard to liberality\nit will similarly be of importance to consider the\ncharacter of the person from whom it proceeds. For\nliberality is more pleasing in a poor man than in a\nrich, in one who confers than in one who returns a\nbenefit, in a father than in a childless man. Again,\nwe must consider the immediate object of the gift,\nthe occasion and the intention, that is to say, whether\nit was given in the hope of subsequent profit; and\nso on with a number of similar considerations. The\nquestion of quality therefore makes the highest\ndemands on the resources of oratory, since it affords\nthe utmost scope for a display of talent on either side, while there is no topic in which the emotional appeal\nis so effective. For conjecture has often to introduce\nproofs from without and uses arguments drawn from\nthe actual subject matter, whereas the real task of\neloquence is to demonstrate quality there lies its\nkingdom, there its power, and there its unique\nvictory. Verginius includes under quality cases concerned\nwith disinheritance, lunacy, cruelty to a wife, and\nclaims of female orphans to marry relatives. The\nquestions thus involved are, it is true, frequently questions of quality, while some writers style them questions of moral obligation. But the laws governing\nthese cases sometimes admit of other bases. For\nexample, conjecture is involved in quite a number of\nsuch cases, as when the accused urges either that he\ndid not commit the act or, if he did, acted with the\nbest intentions. I could quote many examples of\nthis kind. Again, it is definition which tells us what\nprecisely is meant by lunacy or cruelty to a wife.\nFor as a rule the laws cited in such themes involve\ncertain legal questions, though not to such an extent\nas to determine the basis of the case. But this notwithstanding, if the actual fact cannot be defended,\nwe may in the last resort base our defence on legal\ngrounds, in which case we shall consider how many\nand what cases there are in which a father may not\ndisinherit his son, what charges fail to justify an\naction for cruelty, and under what circumstances a\nson is not allowed to accuse his father of lunacy. Disinheritance may be of two kinds. In the first\ncase it is for a completed crime for example, the son\nwho is disinherited may be a ravisher or an adulterer\nin the second case it is for a crime which is still incomplete and terminable; an instance of this will\nbe the case where the son is disinherited because of\ndisobedience to his father. The first form of disinheritance always demands a certain harshness when\nthe father pleads his case, since the act is irrevocable,\nwhereas in the latter his pleading will be of a kindly\nand almost persuasive nature, since he would prefer\nnot to disinherit him. On the other hand, the\npleading of the sons should in both cases be of a\nsubdued character and couched in a conciliatory\ntone. I know that those who delight in making\ncovert attacks upon the father under the disguise\nof some figure of speech will disagree with me\nand I would not deny that their procedure may\nsometimes be justifiable, since the theme may conceivably be such as to demand it; but it is certainly\nto be avoided wherever possible. However, I shall\ndeal with the whole question of figures in a later\nbook. The treatment of the theme of cruelty to a\nwife is not unlike that of the theme of disinheritance; for both demand a certain moderation on the\npart of the accuser. Cases concerned with lunacy\narise either out of what has been done or out of\nsomething which may or may not be done in the\nfuture. In the former case the pleader is free to\nattack as he will, but must none the less do so in\nsuch a manner that, while denouncing the act, he\nwill yet express pity for the father on the ground\nthat he has erred by reason of his infirmity. On the\nother hand, in the latter case, where the act has not yet taken place and there is nothing to prevent the\nfather changing his purpose, he must begin by a\nprolonged attempt to induce him to change his mind,\nand then, and only then, complain that it is madness\nand not depravity of character that prevents him\nfrom listening to the voice of reason; and the more\nhe praises his past character, the easier will it be to\nprove the change which it has undergone owing to\nthe inroads of the disease. The accused, wherever\npossible, must assume a temperate tone in his defence, for the reason that as a rule anger and excitement are near akin to madness. All these cases\nhave this much in common, that the accused does not\nalways defend his act, but often pleads excuse and\nasks for pardon. For these are domestic quarrels, in\nwhich the fact that the offence is an isolated case,\ndue to error and of a less serious character than\nalleged, will sometimes suffice to secure an acquittal. There are, however, a number of other controversial themes involving quality, as, for example,\ncases of assault. In these, although at times the\naccused denies that he committed the assault, the\npleading as a rule is concerned with fact and intention. Then there are cases concerned with the\nappointment of a prosecutor, which are known as\ndivinations. In this connexion Cicero, who was indicting Verres on the instruction of our Sicilian allies,\nadopts the following division-to the effect that the\nmain point for consideration is, by whom those the\nredress of whose wrongs forms the subject of the\ntrial would prefer to be represented, and by whom\nthe accused would least desire them to be represented. But in the great majority of cases the\nquestions raised are, which claimant has the strongest motives for undertaking the role of accuser, which is\nlikely to bring the greatest energy or talent to the\ntask, and which is likely to press the charge with\nthe greatest sincerity. Next we may take cases\nconcerned with guardianship, in which it is usual\nto enquire whether it is necessary to investigate\nanything save the accounts, and whether anything\ncan be demanded of the guardian except the\nhonest execution of his trust; his sagacity and the\nsuccess of his administration being beside the mark.\nCases of fraud on the part of an agent, which are\nstyled cases of conduct of business when they occur in\nthe actual courts, are of a similar nature, since they\nalso are concerned with the administration of a\ntrust. In addition to these we have the fictitious\ncases of the schools which deal with crimes not covered\nby the law, where the question is as a rule either\nwhether the crime is really not covered by the law\nor whether it is a crime, though on rare occasions\nboth questions are raised. Cases of misconduct on\nthe part of an ambassador are of frequent occurrence\namong the Greeks, even in actual life in these the\nlegal question is raised whether it is lawful to deviate\nat all from one's instructions and for how long the\naccused was technically an ambassador, since in some\ncases the ambassador's duty is to convey a communication to a foreign power and in others to bring one\nback. Take for example the case of Heius, who gave\nevidence against Verres after performing his duties\nas ambassador. But in such cases the most important\nquestion turns on the nature of the deed complained\nof Next come cases of action contrary to the interests\nof the state. In these we meet with legal quibbles\nas to what is the meaning of and whether the action of\nthe accused was injurious or profitable, or whether\nthe interests of the state suffered at his hands or\nmerely on his account but the most important\nquestion is that of fact. There are also cases of\ningratitude; in these we raise the question whether\nthe accused has really received any kindness. It is\nonly rarely that the fact can be denied, as denial is\nin itself a sign of ingratitude. But there are the\nfurther questions as to the extent of the kindness\nand whether it has been repaid. If it has not been\nrepaid, does this necessarily involve ingratitude\nWas it in his power to repay Did he really owe\nthe return which was demanded of him What is\nhis intention Somewhat simpler are cases of\nunjust divorce, a form of controversy which has this\npeculiarity, that the accuser defends and the defendant accuses. Further there are cases where\na senator sets forth to the senate the reasons which\ndetermine him to commit suicide, in which there is one\nlegal question, namely, whether a man who desires to\nkill himself in order to escape the clutches of the\nlaw ought to be prevented from so doing, while the\nremaining questions are all concerned with quality.\nThere are also fictitious cases concerned with wills,\nin which the only question raised is one of quality, as,\nfor instance, in the controversial theme quoted above,\nwhere the philosopher, physician and orator all\nclaim the fourth share which their father had left\nto the most worthy of his sons. The same is true\nof cases where suitors of equal rank claim the\nhand of an orphan and the question confronting her\nrelatives is which is the most suitable. I do not,\nhowever, intend to discuss every possible theme, since fresh ones can always be invented, nor yet to\ndeal with all the questions to which they give rise,\nsince these vary with circumstances. But I cannot\nhelp expressing my astonishment that Flavus, for\nwhose authority I have the highest respect, restricted\nthe range of quality to such an extent in the text-book\nwhich he composed for the special guidance of the\nschools. Quantity also, as I have already stated, falls as a\nrule, though not always, under the head of quality,\nwhether it is concerned with measure or number.\nMeasure, however, sometimes consists in the valuation\nof a deed with a view to determining the amount\nof guilt or the amount of benefit involved, while, on\nthe other hand, it sometimes turns on a point of\nlaw, when the dispute is under what law a man\nis to be punished or rewarded. For example is a\nravisher to pay 10,000 sesterces because that is the\npenalty appointed by law, or is he liable to capital\npunishment as a murderer because his victim hanged\nhimself In such cases those who plead as if there\nwere a question between two laws, are wrong for\nthere is no dispute about the fine of 10,000,\nsince it is not claimed by the prosecution. The\npoint on which judgment has to be delivered is\nwhether the accused is guilty of causing his victim's\ndeath. The same type of case will also bring\nconjecture into play, when, for example, the question\nin dispute is whether the accused shall be punished\nwith banishment for life or for five years. For the\nquestion then is whether he caused his death\nwillingly or not. Again, there are questions concerned with numerical quantity which turn on a\npoint of law, such as the questions whether thirty rewards are due to Thrasybulus, or whether, when\ntwo thieves have stolen a sum of money, they are\neach to be required to refund fourfold or twofold.\nBut in these cases, too, valuation of the act is\nnecessary, and yet the point of law also turns on\nquality. V. He who neither denies nor defends his act nor\nasserts that it was of a different nature from that\nalleged, must take his stand on some point of law\nthat tells in his favour, a form of defence which\ngenerally turns on the legality of the action brought\nagainst him. This question is not, however, as some\nhave held, always raised before the commencement\nof the trial, like the elaborate deliberations of the\npraetor when there is a doubt as to whether the\nprosecutor has any legal standing, but frequently\ncomes up during the course of the actual trial. Such\ndiscussions fall into two classes, according as the point\nin dispute arises from an argument advanced by the\nprosecution or from some prescription or demurrer\nput forward by the defence. There have indeed\nbeen some writers who have held that there is a\nspecial prescriptive basis; but prescription is covered\nby precisely the same questions that cover all other\nlaws. When the dispute turns on prescription, there\nis no need to enquire into the facts of the case\nitself. For example, a son puts forward a demurrer\nagainst his father on the ground that his father has\nforfeited his civil rights. The only point which has\nto be decided is whether the demurrer can stand.\nStill, wherever possible, we should attempt to create\na favourable impression in the judge as to the facts\nof the case as well, since, if this be done, he will be\nall the more disposed to give an indulgent hearing to our point of law for example, in actions taking\nthe form of a wager and arising out of interdicts,\neven though the question is concerned solely with\nactual possession, the question as to tile right to\npossession not being raised, it will be desirable to\nprove not merely that the property was actually in\nour possession, but that it was ours to possess. On\ntile other hand, the question more frequently turns\non intention. Take the law I deny that he is entitled to receive\nwhatever he chooses. I cannot put forward any\nformal demurrer, but none the less I use the intention as against the letter of the law just as I should\nuse a demurrer. In both cases the basis is the same. Moreover every law either gives or takes away\npunishes or commands, forbids or permits, and\ninvolves a dispute either on its own account or on\naccount of another law, while the question which it\ninvolves will turn either on the letter or the intention.\nThe letter is either clear or obscure or ambiguous.\nAnd what I say with reference to laws will apply\nequally to wills, agreements, contracts and every\nform of document; nay, it will apply even to verbal\nagreements. And since I have classified such cases\nunder four questions or bases, I will deal with each in\nturn. Lawyers frequently raise the question of the\nletter and the intention of the law, in fact a large\nproportion of legal disputes turn on these points.\nWe need not therefore be surprised that such\nquestions occur in the schools as well, where they\nare often invented with this special purpose. One\nform of this kind of question is found in cases where\ntile enquiry turns both on the letter and the spirit of a law. Such questions arise when the law presents\nsome obscurity. Under these circumstances both\nparties will seek to establish their own interpretation\nof the passage and to overthrow that advanced by\ntheir opponent. Take for example the following\ncase. The accuser will urge that the sum which he claims\nis fourfold the amount stolen; the accused will urge\nthat the sum which they offer to pay is fourfold.\nThe intention of the law will be pleaded by both\nparties. On the other hand, the dispute may turn\non a passage of the law which is clear in one sense\nand doubtful in another. Here there is no doubt about\nthe son of one who was a prostitute before his birth,\nbut it is doubtful whether the law applies to the case\nof one born before his mother became a prostitute.\nAnother question which is not infrequently raised is\nas to the interpretation of the law forbidding an action\nto be brought twice on the same dispute, the problem\nbeing whether the word twice refers to the prosecutor\nor the prosecution. Such are the points arising out\nof the obscurity of the law. A second form of question turns on some passage\nwhere the meaning is clear. Those who have given\nexclusive attention to this class of question call it\nthe basis concerned with the obvious expression of the\nlaw and its intention. In such circumstances one\nparty will rest their case on the letter, the other on the intention of the law. There are three\ndifferent methods in which we may combat the letter.\nThe first comes into play where it is clear that it is\nimpossible always to observe the letter of the law. It is clear, in the first place, that\nthis cannot apply to an infant. At this point we\nshall turn to other possible exceptions and distinguish\nas follows. The\nsecond arises in scholastic themes where no argument can be drawn from the particular law, but the\nquestion is concerned solely with the subject of the\ndispute. In this\ncase we shall not have two separate questions,\nnamely, whether every foreigner who goes up on\nthe wall is liable to the penalty, and whether this\nparticular foreigner is liable, since no more forcible\nargument can be brought against the application of\nthe letter of the law than the fact in dispute, but the\nonly question to be raised will be whether a foreigner\nmay not go on to the wall even for the purpose of\nsaving the city. Therefore we shall rest our case on\nequity and the intention of the law. It is, however,\nsometimes possible to draw examples from other laws\nto show that we cannot always stand by the letter,\nas Cicero did in his defence of Caecina. The third\nmethod becomes operative when we find something\nin the actual words of the law which enables us to\nprove that the intention of the legislator was different. The following theme will provide an example. In this case the use of the word caught is sufficient\nproof that the word steel was only intended by the\nlaw in the sense of a weapon of offence. But just as the advocate who rests his case on the\nintention of the law must wherever possible impugn\nthe letter of the law, so he who defends the letter\nof the law must also seek to gain support from the\nintention. Again, in cases concerned with wills it\nsometimes happens that the intention of the testator\nis clear, though it has not been expressed in writing\nan example of this occurs in the trial of Curius, which\ngave rise to the well-known argument between\nLucius Crassus and Scaevola. A second heir had\nbeen appointed in the event of a posthumous son\ndying while a minor. No posthumous son was born.\nThe next of kin claimed the property. Who could\ndoubt that the intention of the testator was that\nthe same man should inherit in the event of the\nson not being born who would have inherited in the\nevent of his death But he had not written this in\nhis will. Again, the opposite case, that is to say,\nwhen what is written is obviously contrary to tile\nintention of the writer, occurred quite recently. A\nman who had made a bequest of 5000 sesterces, on\naltering his will erased the word sesterces and inserted\npounds of silver. But it was clear that he had meant\nnot 5000 but 5 pounds of silver, because the weight\nof silver mentioned in the bequest was unparalleled\nand incredible. The same basis includes such general\nquestions as to whether we should stand by the letter or the intention of the document, and what\nwas the purpose of the writer, while for the treatment of such questions we must have recourse to\nquality or conjecture, with which I think I have dealt\nin sufficient detail. The next subject which comes up for discussion is that of contrary laws. For all writers\nof text-books are agreed that in such cases there\nare two bases involving the letter and the intention\nof the law respectively. This view is justified by\nthe fact that, when one law contradicts another, both\nparties attack the letter and raise the question of\nintention, while the point in dispute, as regards each\nlaw, is whether we should be guided by it at all. But\nit is clear to everybody that one law cannot contradict\nanother in principle since if there were two different\nprinciples, one law would cancel the other, and\nthat the laws in question are brought into collision\npurely by the accidents of chance. When two laws clash, they may be of a similar\nnature, as for instance if we have to compare two\ncases in which a tyrannicide and a brave man are\ngiven the choice of their reward, both being granted\nthe privilege of choosing whatever they desire. In\nsuch a case we compare the deserts of the claimants,\nthe occasions of the respective acts and the nature\nof the rewards claimed. Or the same law may be\nin conflict with itself, as in the case where we have\ntwo brave men, two tyrannicides or two ravished\nwomen, when the question must turn either on time\nthat is, whose claim has priority or on quality that\nis, whose claim is the more just. Again, we may\nhave a conflict between diverse, similar or dissimilar\nlaws. Diverse laws are those against which arguments may be brought without reference to any contradictory law. The following theme will provide an\nexample. In this case, even though\nthere be no other law covering the case, we may\nraise the question whether a hero ought to be\ngranted anything he chooses to claim. Again, many\nconclusive arguments may be brought against the\nletter of the law restricting the movements of the\nmagistrate for example, a fire may have broken out\nin the citadel, or a sally against the enemy may have\nbeen necessary. Laws are styled similar when nothing can be opposed to one except the other. Here are two conflicting laws for a woman's statue\ncannot under any other circumstances be erected in\nthe gymnasium, while there is no other circumstance\nwhich can bar the erection of the statue of a\ntyrannicide in the gymnasium. Laws are styled\ndissimilar when many arguments can be urged against\none, while the only point which can be urged against\nthe other is the actual subject of dispute. An\nexample is provided by the case in which a brave\nman demands the pardon of a deserter as his reward.\nFor there are many arguments, as I have shown\nabove, which can be urged against the law permitting\na hero to choose whatever reward he will, but\nthe letter of the law dealing with the crime of\ndesertion cannot be overthrown under any circumstances save the choice of rewards to which I have\njust referred. Again, the point of law is either admitted by\nboth parties or disputed. If it be admitted, the\nquestions which are raised will as a rule be such\nas the following. Which of the two laws is the\nmost stringent Does it concern gods or men, the\nstate or private individuals, reward or punishment,\ngreat things or small Does it permit, forbid or\ncommand Another common question is which of\nthe two laws is the oldest; but the most important\nquestion is which of the two laws will suffer less by\nits contravention, as for example in the case of the\nhero and the deserter just mentioned, in which case,\nif the deserter is not put to death, the whole law is\nignored, whereas, if he be put to death, the hero\nwill still have another choice left open to him. It\nis, however, of the utmost importance to consider\nwhich course is best from the point of view of\nmorality and justice, a problem for the solution of\nwhich no general rules can be laid down, as it will\ndepend on the special circumstances of the case. If,\non the other hand, the point of law is disputed, either\none party or both in turn will argue the point. Take\nthe following case as an example. Here the father claims his right\nover the son, while the son, in virtue of his new position\nas patron, denies that his father possessed the rights\nof a father, because he was in the power of his patron. Laws containing two provisions may conflict with\nthemselves in exactly the same way as two laws may\nconflict. The following will serve as an illustration. All that I have\nsaid about laws will also apply to decrees of the\nsenate. If decrees of the senate conflict with one\nanother or with the laws, the basis will be the same\nas if laws only were concerned. The syllogistic basis has some resemblance\nto the basis concerned with the letter and intention of\nthe law, since whenever it comes into play, one party\nrests his case on the letter there is, however, this\ndifference between the two bases, that in the latter\nwe argue against the letter, in the present beyond\nthe letter, while in the latter the party defending\nthe letter aims at securing that in any case the letter\nmay be carried into effect, whereas in the present his\naim will be to prevent anything except the letter\nbeing carried into effect. The syllogism is sometimes\nemployed in conjunction with definition for often if\nthe definition be weak it takes refuge in the syllogism.\nAssume a law to run as follows The strongest\nline for the accuser to take will be to assert that\nthe love-potion was a poison. This involves definition.\nIf it proves weak, we shall have recourse to the\nsyllogism, to which we shall proceed after virtually dropping our previous argument, and which we shall\nemploy to decide the question whether she does not\ndeserve to be punished for administering the lovepotion no less than if she had caused her husband's\ndeath by poison. The syllogistic basis, then, deduces from the letter\nof the law that which is uncertain; and since this\nconclusion is arrived at by reason, the basis is called\nratiocinative. It may be subdivided into the following species of question. If it is right to do a thing\nonce, is it right to do it often Example If the law\ngrants a privilege with reference to one thing, does\nit grant it with reference to a number Example If a thing is legal before a certain\noccurrence, is it legal after it Example Is that which is lawful\nwith regard to the whole, lawful with regard to a\npart Example Is that\nwhich is lawful with regard to a part, lawful with\nregard to the whole Example In all these cases the syllogism rests on the letter of\nthe law as well for the accuser urges that the\nprovisions of the law are precise. He will say, or or and so on. But to this we may reply, Thus we infer what is doubtful\nfrom what is certain. It is a more difficult task to\ndeduce from the letter of the law that which is not\nactually prescribed by the letter, and to argue because\nthat is the case, so also is this. Take the following\nproblems. or Under this\nheading come questions such as the following if\nthere is not a special law applicable to the case, ought\nwe to have recourse to an analogous law is the\npoint in question similar to what is contained in the\nletter of the law Now it should be noted that what\nis similar may be greater, equal or less. In the first\nease we enquire whether the provisions of the law\nare sufficient, or, if they are insufficient, whether we\nshould have recourse to this other law. In both\ncases it is a question of the intention of the legislator.\nBut the most effective form of treatment in such\ncases will be to appeal to equity. I turn to tile discussion of ambiguity, which will\nbe found to have countless species indeed, in the\nopinion of certain philosophers, there is not a single\nword which has not a diversity of meanings. There\nare, however, very few genera, since ambiguity must\noccur either in a single word or in a group of words. Single words give rise to error, when the same\nnoun applies to a number of things or persons the\nGreeks call this homonymy for example, it is uncertain with regard to the word gallus whether it\nmeans a cock or a Gaul or a proper name or an\nemasculated priest of tybele; while Ajax may refer\neither to the son of Telamon or the son of Oileus.\nAgain, verbs likewise may have different meanings,\nas, for example, cerno. This ambiguity crops up in\nmany ways, and gives rise to disputes, mole especially\nin connexion with wills, when two men of the same\nname claim their freedom or, it may be, an inheritance, or again, when the enquiry turns on the precise\nnature of the bequest. There is another form of\nambiguity where a word has one meaning when\nentire and another when divided, as, for example,\ningenua, armameniam or Corvinum. The disputes\narising from such ambiguities are no more than\nchildish quibbles, but nevertheless the Greeks are\nin the habit of making them the subject for controversial themes, as, for example, in the notorious\ncase of the when the question is whether\nit is a hall which has fallen down three times  or a flute-player who fell down that is to be sold.\nA third form of ambiguity is caused by the use of\ncompound words; for example, if a man orders his\nbody to be buried in a cultivated spot, and should\ndirect, as is often done, a considerable space of land\nsurrounding his tomb to be taken from the land left\nto his heirs with a view to preserving his ashes from\noutrage, an occasion for dispute may be afforded by\nthe question whether the words mean in culto loco or inculto loco. Thus arises the Greek theme about Leon and Pantaleon, who go to law because\nthe handwriting of a will makes it uncertain whether\nthe testator has left all his property to Leon or his\nproperty to Pantaleon. Groups of words give rise to more serious ambiguity. Such ambiguity may arise from doubt as\nto a case, as in the following passage Or it may arise from the arrangement of the words,\nwhich makes it doubtful what the exact reference of\nsome word or words may be, more especially when\nthere is a word in the middle of the sentence which\nmay be referred either to what precedes or what\nfollows, as in the line of Virgil which describes\nTroilus as where it may be disputed whether the poet means\nthat he is still holding the reins, or that, although\nhe holds the reins, he is still dragged along. The\ncontroversial theme, turns on a similar ambiguity; for it raises\nthe question whether it is the statue holding the\nspear which is to be of gold, or whether the spear\nshould be of gold and the statue of some other\nmaterial. The same result is even more frequently\nproduced by a mistaken inflexion of the voice, as in\nthe line It is also often doubtful to which of two antecedents\na phrase is to be referred. Hence we get such controversial themes as, where it is left uncertain which of the\ntwo is to make the choice. But in these examples of ambiguity, the first may\nbe remedied by a change of case, the second by\nseparating 1 the words or altering their position, the\nthird by some addition. Ambiguity resulting from\nthe use of two accusatives may be removed by the\nsubstitution of the ablative for example, Lachetem\naudivi percussisse Demeam I heard that Demea struck\nLaches, or that L. struck D. may be rendered clear\nby writing a Lachete percussum Demeam that D. was\nstruck by L.. There is, however, a natural ambiguity in the ablative case itself, as I pointed out\nin the first book. For example, caelo decurrit aperto\nleaves it doubtful whether the poet means he\nhastened down or Words may\nbe separated by a breathing space or pause. We\nmay, for instance, say statuam, and then, after a\nslight pause, add auream hastam, or the pause may\ncome between statuam auream and haslam. The\naddition referred to above would take the form quod\nelegerit ipse, where ipse will show that the reference\nto the heir, or quod elegerit ipsa, making the reference\nto the wife. In cases where ambiguity is caused\nby the addition of a word, the difficulty may be\neliminated by the removal of a word, as in the\nsentence nos flentes illos deprehendimus. Where it\nis doubtful to what a word or phrase refers, and the\nword or phrase itself is ambiguous, we shall have to\nalter several words, as, for example, in the sentence, where is ambiguous. Cicero\ncommits the same fault when he says of Gaius\nFannius, For over himself may refer either to his\nfather-in-law or to Fannius. Again, another source\nof ambiguity arises from leaving it doubtful in a\nwritten document whether a syllable is long or short.\nCato, for example, means one thing in the nominative when its second syllable is short, and another in\nthe dative or ablative when the same syllable is long.\nThere are also a number of other forms of ambiguity\nwhich it is unnecessary for me to describe at length. Further, it is quite unimportant how ambiguity\narises or how it is remedied. For it is clear in all\ncases that two interpretations are possible, and as\nfar as the written or spoken word is concerned,\nit is equally important for both parties. It is\ntherefore a perfectly futile rule which directs us to\nendeavour, in connexion with this basis, to turn the\nword in question to suit our own purpose, since, if\nthis is feasible, there is no ambiguity. In cases of\nambiguity the only questions which confront us will\nbe, sometimes which of the two interpretations is\nmost natural, and always which interpretation is\nmost equitable, and what was the intention of the\nperson who wrote or uttered the words. I have,\nhowever, given sufficient instructions in the course\nof my remarks on conjecture and quality, as to the\nmethod of treating such questions, whether by the\nprosecution or the defence. There is, however, a certain affinity between\nall these bases. For in definition we enquire into the\nmeaning of a term, and in the syllogism, which is\nclosely connected with definition, we consider what\nwas the meaning of the writer, while it is obvious\nthat in the case of contrary laws there are two bases,\none concerned with the letter, and the other with\nthe intention. Again, definition is in itself a kind of\nambiguity, since it brings out two meanings in the\nsame term. The basis concerned with the letter and\nthe intention of the law involves a legal question as\nregards the interpretation of the words, which is\nidentical with the question arising out of contrary\nlaws. Consequently some writers have asserted that\nall these bases may be resolved into those concerned\nwith the letter and intention, while others hold that\nin all cases where the letter and the intention of a\ndocument have to be considered, it is ambiguity that\ngives rise to the question at issue. But all these\nbases are really distinct, for an obscure point of law\nis not the same as an ambiguous point of law.\nDefinition, then, involves a general question as to\nthe actual nature of a term, a question which may\nconceivably have no connexion whatsoever with the\ncontent of the case in point. In investigations as\nto the letter and the intention, the dispute turns on\nthe provisions contained in the law, whereas the\nsyllogism deals with that which is not contained in\nthe law. In disputes arising out of ambiguity we\nare led from the ambiguous phrase to its conflicting\nmeanings, whereas in the case of contrary laws the\nfight starts from the conflict of their provisions.\nThe distinction between these bases has therefore\nbeen rightly accepted by the most learned of rhetoricians, and is still adopted by the majority\nand the wisest of the teachers of to-day. It has not been possible in this connexion to give\ninstructions which will cover the arrangement to be\nadopted in every case, though I have been able to\ngive some. There are other details concerning which\nI can give no instructions without a statement of the\nparticular case on which the orator has to speak.\nFor not only must the whole case be analysed into\nits component topics and questions, but these subdivisions themselves require to be arranged in the\norder which is appropriate to them. For example,\nin the exordium each part has its own special place,\nfirst, second and third, etc., while each question and\ntopic requires to be suitably arranged, and the same\nis true even of isolated general questions. For it will\nnot, I imagine, be represented that sufficient skill\nin division is possessed by the man who, after resolving a controversial theme into questions such as\nthe following, whether a hero is to be granted any\nreward that he may claim, whether he is allowed to\nclaim private property, whether he may demand any\nwoman in marriage, whether he may claim to marry\na woman who already possesses a husband, or this\nparticular woman, then, although it is his duty to\ndeal with the first question first, proceeds to deal\nwith them indiscriminately as each may happen to\noccur to him, and ignores the fact that the first\npoint which should be discussed is whether we\nshould stand by the letter or the intention of the\nlaw, and fails to follow the natural order, which\ndemands that after beginning with this question he\nshould then proceed to introduce the subsidiary\nquestions, thereby making the structure of his speech as regular as that of the human body, of which, for\nexample, the hand is a part, while the fingers are\nparts of the hand, and the joints of the fingers. It\nis precisely this method of arrangement which it is\nimpossible to demonstrate except with reference to\nsome definite and specific case. But it is clearly\nuseless to take one or two cases, or even a hundred\nor a thousand, since their number is infinite. It is\nthe duty of the teacher to demonstrate daily in one\nkind of case after another what is the natural order\nand connexion of the parts, so that little by little\nhis pupils may gain the experience which will enable\nthem to deal with other cases of the same character.\nFor it is quite impossible to teach everything that\ncan be accomplished by art. For example, what\npainter has ever been taught to reproduce everything\nin nature But once he has acquired the general\nprinciples of imitation, he will be able to copy whatever is given him. What vase-maker is there who\nhas not succeeded in producing a vase of a type\nwhich he had never previously seen There are, however, some things which depend\nnot on the teacher, but on the learner. For example,\na physician will teach what treatment should be\nadopted for different diseases, what the dangers are\nagainst which he must be on his guard, and what\nthe symptoms by which they may be recognised. But\nhe will not be able to communicate to his pupil the\ngift of feeling the pulse, or appreciating the variations\nof colour, breathing and temperature this will\ndepend on the talent of the individual. Therefore,\nin most instances, we must rely on ourselves,\nand must study cases with the utmost care, never forgetting that men discovered our art before ever\nthey proceeded to teach it. For the most effective,\nand what is justly styled most economical arrangement of a case as a whole, is that which cannot be\ndetermined except when we have the specific facts\nbefore us. It consists in the power to determine\nwhen the exordium is necessary and when it should\nbe omitted; when we should make our statement of\nfacts continuous, and when we should subdivide it;\nwhen we should begin at the very beginning, when,\nlike Homer, start at the middle or the end; when\nwe should omit the statement of facts altogether;\nwhen we should begin by dealing with the arguments\nadvanced by our opponents, and when with our own;\nwhen we should place the strongest proofs first and\nwhen the weakest; in what cases we should prefix\nquestions to the exordium, and what preparation is\nnecessary to pave the way for these questions; what\narguments the judge will accept at once, and to\nwhat he requires to be led by degrees; whether we\nshould refute our opponent's arguments as a whole\nor in detail; whether we should reserve emotional\nappeals for the peroration or distribute them throughout the whole speech; whether we should speak first\nof law or of equity; whether we should first advance\nor refute charges as to past offences or the charges\nconnected with the actual trial; or, again, if the\ncase is complicated, what order we should adopt,\nwhat evidence or documents of any kind should\nbe read out in the course of our speech, and what\nreserved for a later stage. This gift of arrangement\nis to oratory what generalship is to war. The skilled\ncommander will know how to distribute his forces for battle, what troops he should keep back to\ngarrison forts or guard cities, to secure supplies, or\nguard communications, and what dispositions to make\nby land and by sea. But to possess this gift, our\norator will require all the resources of nature, learning\nand industrious study. Therefore let no man hope\nthat he can acquire eloquence merely by the labour\nof others. He must burn the midnight oil, persevere\nto the end and grow pale with study he must form\nhis own powers, his own experience, his own\nmethods he must not require to hunt for his\nweapons, but must have them ready for immediate\nuse, as though they were born with him and not\nderived from the instruction of others. The road\nmay be pointed out, but our speed must be our\nown. Art has done enough in publishing the\nresources of eloquence, it is for us to know how to\nuse them. And it is not enough merely to arrange\nthe various parts each several part has its own\ninternal economy, according to which one thought\nwill come first, another second, another third, while\nwe must struggle not merely to place these thoughts\nin their proper order, but to link them together and\ngive them such cohesion that there will be no trace\nof any suture they must form a body, not a congeries\nof limbs. This end will be attained if we note what\nbest suits each position, and take care that the words\nwhich we place together are such as will not clash,\nbut will mutually harmonise. Thus different facts\nwill not seem like perfect strangers thrust into\nuncongenial company from distant places, but will\nbe united with what precedes and follows by an\nintimate bond of union, with the result that our speech will give the impression not merely of having\nbeen put together, but of natural continuity. I fear,\nhowever, that I have been lured on from one thing to\nanother and have advanced somewhat too far, since\nI find myself gliding from the subject of arrangement to the discussion of the general rules of style,\nwhich will form the opening theme of the next\nbook.  THE observations contained in the preceding five\nbooks approximately cover the method of invention\nand the arrangement of the material thus provided.\nIt is absolutely necessary to acquire a thorough\nknowledge of this method in all its details, if we\ndesire to become accomplished orators, but a simpler\nand briefer course of instruction is more suitable for\nbeginners. For they tend either to be deterred from\nstudy by the difficulties of so detailed and complicated\na course, or lose heart at having to attempt tasks of\nsuch difficulty just at the very period when their\nminds need special nourishment and a more attractive form of diet, or think that when they have\nlearned this much and no more, they are fully\nequipped for the tasks of eloquence, or finally, regarding themselves as fettered by certain fixed laws\nof oratory, shrink from making any effort on their\nown initiative. Consequently, it has been held that\nthose who have exercised the greatest care in\nwriting text-books of rhetoric have been the furthest\nremoved from genuine eloquence. Still, it is absolutely necessary to point out to beginners the road\nwhich they should follow, though this road must be\nsmooth and easy not merely to enter, but to indicate.\nConsequently, our skilful instructor should select all that is best in the various writers on the subject\nand content himself for the moment with imparting\nthose precepts of which he approves, without wasting\ntime over the refutation of those which he does not\napprove. For thus your pupils will follow where you\nlead. Later, as they acquire strength in speaking,\ntheir learning will grow in proportion. To begin\nwith, they may be allowed to think that there is no\nother road than that on which we have set their\nfeet, and it may be left to time to teach them what\nis actually the best. It is true that writers on\nrhetoric have, by the pertinacity with which they\nhave defended their opinions, made the principles\nof the science which they profess somewhat complicated; but these principles are in reality neither\nobscure nor hard to understand. Consequently, if\nwe regard the treatment of the art as a whole, it is\nharder to decide what we should teach than to teach\nit, once the decision has been made. Above all, in\nthe two departments which I have mentioned, the\nnecessary rules are but few in number, and if the\npupil gives them ready acceptance, he will find that\nthe path to further accomplishment presents no\ndifficulty. I have, it is true, already expended much labour\non this portion of my task; for I desired to make\nit clear that rhetoric is the science of speaking well,\nthat it is useful, and further, that it is an art and a\nvirtue. I wished also to show that its subject matter\nconsists of everything on which an orator may be\ncalled to speak, and is, as a rule, to be found in three\nclasses of oratory, demonstrative, deliberative, and\nforensic; that every speech is composed of matter\nand words, and that as regards matter we must study invention, as regards words, style, and as\nregards both, arrangement, all of which it is the\ntask of memory to retain and delivery to render\nattractive. I attempted to show that the duty of\nthe orator is composed of instructing, moving and\ndelighting his hearers, statement of facts and argument falling under the head of instruction, while\nemotional appeals are concerned with moving the\naudience and, although they may be employed\nthroughout the case, are most effective at the beginning and end. As to the element of charm, I\npointed out that, though it may reside both in facts\nand words, its special sphere is that of style. I\nobserved that there are two kinds of questions, the\none indefinite, the other definite, and involving the\nconsideration of persons and circumstances of time\nand place; further, that whatever our subject matter, there are three questions which we must ask, is\nit what is it and of what kind is it To this I\nadded that demonstrative oratory consists of praise\nand denunciation, and that in this connexion we\nmust consider not merely the acts actually performed by the person of whom we were speaking,\nbut what happened after his death. This task I\nshowed to be concerned solely with what is honourable or expedient. I remarked that in deliberative\noratory there is a third department as well which\ndepends on conjecture, for we have to consider\nwhether the subject of deliberation is possible or\nlikely to happen. At this point I emphasised the\nimportance of considering who it is that is speaking,\nbefore whom he is speaking, and what he says. As\nregards forensic cases, I demonstrated that some\nturn on one point of dispute, others on several, and that whereas in some cases it is the attack, in others\nin is the defence that determines the basis; that\nevery defence rests on denial, which is of two kinds,\nsince we may either deny that the act was committed or that its nature was that alleged, while it\nfurther consists of justification and technical pleas\nto show that the action cannot stand. I proceeded\nto show that questions must turn either on something written or something done in the latter\ncase we have to consider the truth of the facts\ntogether with their special character and quality;\nin the former we consider the meaning or the\nintention of the words, with reference to which we\nusually examine the nature of all cases, criminal or\ncivil, which fall under the heads of the letter and\nintention, the syllogism, ambiguity or contrary lairs.\nI went on to point out that in all forensic cases the\nspeech consists of five parts, the exordium designed\nto conciliate the audience, the statement of facts\ndesigned to instruct him, the proof which confirms\nour own propositions, the refutation which overthrows\nthe arguments of our opponents, and the peroration\nwhich either refreshes the memory of our hearers\nor plays upon their emotions. I then dealt with the\nsources of arguments and emotion, and indicated\nthe means by which the judges should be excited,\nplacated, or amused. Finally I demonstrated the\nmethod of division. But I would ask that the\nstudent who is really desirous of learning should\nbelieve that there are also a variety of subjects with\nregard to which nature itself should provide much\nof the requisite knowledge without any assistance\nfrom formal teaching, so that the precepts of which\nI have spoken may be regarded not so much as having been discovered by the professors of rhetoric\nas having been noted by them when they presented\nthemselves. The points which follow require greater care and\nindustry. For I have now to discuss the theory of\nstyle, a subject which, as all orators agree, presents\nthe greatest difficulty. For Marcus Antonius, whom\nI mentioned above, states that lie has seen many\ngood, but no really eloquent speakers, and holds\nthat, while to be a good speaker it is sufficient to\nsay what is necessary, only the really eloquent\nspeaker can do this in ornate and appropriate language. And if this excellence was to be found in\nno orator up to his own day, and not even in himself\nor Lucius Crassus, we may regard it as certain that\nthe reason why they and their predecessors lacked\nthis gift was its extreme difficulty of acquisition.\nAgain, Cicero holds that, while invention and\narrangement are within the reach of any man of\ngood sense, eloquence belongs to the orator alone,\nand consequently it was on the rules for the cultivation of eloquence that he expended the greatest\ncare. That he was justified in so doing is shown\nclearly by the actual name of the art of which I am\nspeaking. For the verb eloqui means the production\nand communication to the audience of all that the\nspeaker has conceived in his mind, and without this\npower all the preliminary accomplishments of oratory\nare as useless as a sword that is kept permanently\nconcealed within its sheath. Therefore it is on this\nthat teachers of rhetoric concentrate their attention, since it cannot possibly be acquired without\nthe assistance of the rules of artit is this which\nis the chief object of our study, the goal of all our exercises and all our efforts at imitation, and it\nis to this that we devote the energies of a lifetime;\nit is this that makes one orator surpass his rivals,\nthis that makes one style of speaking preferable to\nanother. The failure of the orators of the Asiatic\nand other decadent schools did not lie in their\ninability to grasp or arrange the facts on which\nthey had to speak, nor, on the other hand, were\nthose who professed what we call the dry style of\noratory either fools or incapable of understanding\nthe cases in which they were engaged. No, the\nfault of the former was that they lacked taste and\nrestraint in speaking, while the latter lacked power,\nwhence it is clear that it is here that the real faults\nand virtues of oratory are to be found. This does not, however, mean that we should\ndevote ourselves to the study of words alone. For\nI am compelled to offer the most prompt and determined resistance to those who would at the very\nportals of this enquiry lay hold of the admissions\nI have just made and, disregarding the subject\nmatter which, after all, is the backbone of any\nspeech, devote themselves to the futile and crippling\nstudy of words in a vain desire to acquire the gift of\nelegance, a gift which I myself regard as the fairest\nof all the glories of oratory, but only when it is\nnatural and unaffected. Healthy bodies, enjoying\na good circulation and strengthened by exercise,\nacquire grace from the same source that gives them\nstrength, for they have a healthy complexion, firm\nflesh and shapely thews. But, on the other hand,\nthe man who attempts to enhance these physical\ngraces by the effeminate use of depilatories and cosmetics, succeeds merely in defacing them by the very care which he bestows on them. Again, a\ntasteful and magnificent dress, as the Greek poet\ntells us, lends added dignity to its wearer but\neffeminate and luxurious apparel fails to adorn the\nbody and merely reveals the foulness of the mind.\nSimilarly, a translucent and iridescent style merely\nserves to emasculate the subject which it arrays with\nsuch pomp of words. Therefore I would have the\norator, while careful in his choice of words, be even\nmore concerned about his subject matter. For, as a\nrule, the best words are essentially suggested by the\nsubject matter and are discovered by their own\nintrinsic light. But to-day we hunt for these words\nas though they were always hiding themselves and\nstriving to elude our grasp. And thus we fail to\nrealise that they are to be found in the subject of\nour speech, and seek them elsewhere, and, when we\nhave found them, force them to suit their context.\nIt is with a more virile spirit that we should pursue\neloquence, who, if only her whole body be sound,\nwill never think it her duty to polish her nails and\ntire her hair. The usual result of over-attention to the niceties\nof style is the deterioration of our eloquence. The\nmain reason for this is that those words are best\nwhich are least far-fetched and give the impression\nof simplicity and reality. For those words which are\nobviously the result of careful search and even seem to\nparade their self-conscious art, fail to attain the grace\nat which they aim and lose all appearance of sincerity\nbecause they darken the sense and choke the good\nseed by their own luxuriant overgrowth. For in\nour passion for words we paraphrase what might be\nsaid in plain language, repeat what we have already said at sufficient length, pile up a number of words\nwhere one would suffice, and regard allusion as\nbetter than directness of speech. So, too, all\ndirectness of speech is at a discount, and we think no\nphrase eloquent that another could conceivably have\nused. We borrow figures and metaphors from the\nmost decadent poets, and regard it as a real sign\nof genius that it should require a genius to understand our meaning. And yet Cicero long since\nlaid down this rule in the clearest of language, that\nthe worst fault in speaking is to adopt a style inconsistent with the idiom of ordinary speech and\ncontrary to the common feeling of mankind. But\nnowadays our rhetoricians regard Cicero as lacking\nboth polish and learning; we are far superior, for\nwe look upon everything that is dictated by nature\nas beneath our notice, and seek not for the true\nornaments of speech, but for meretricious finery, as\nthough there were any real virtue in words save in\ntheir power to represent facts. And if we have to\nspend all our life in the laborious effort to discover\nwords which will at once be brilliant, appropriate\nand lucid, and to arrange them with exact precision,\nwe lose all the fruit of our studies. And yet we see\nthe majority of modern speakers wasting their time\nover the discovery of single words and over the\nelaborate weighing and measurement of such words\nwhen once discovered. Even if the special aim of\nsuch a practice were always to secure the best words,\nsuch an ill-starred form of industry would be much\nto be deprecated, since it checks tile natural current\nof our speech and extinguishes the warmth of\nimagination by the delay and loss of self-confidence\nwhich it occasions. For the orator who cannot endure to lose a single word is like a man plunged\nin griping poverty. On the other hand, if he will\nonly first form a true conception of the principles of\neloquence, accumulate a copious supply of words by\nwide and suitable reading, apply the art of arrangement to the words thus acquired, and finally, by\ncontinual exercise, develop strength to use his\nacquisitions so that every word is ready at hand\nand lies under his very eyes, he will never lose a\nsingle word. For the man who follows these instructions will find that facts and words appropriate\nto their expression will present themselves spontaneously. But it must be remembered that a long\ncourse of preliminary study is necessary and that\nthe requisite ability must not merely be acquired,\nbut carefully stored for use; for the anxiety devoted\nto the search for words, to the exercise of the\ncritical faculty and the power of comparison is in its\nplace while we are learning, but not when we are\nspeaking. Otherwise, the orator who has not given\nsufficient attention to preliminary study will be like\na man who, having no fortune, lives from hand to\nmouth. If, on the other hand, the powers of speech\nhave been carefully cultivated beforehand, words\nwill yield us ready service, not merely turning up\nwhen we search for them, but dwelling in our\nthoughts and following them as the shadow follows\nthe body. There are, however, limits even to this\nform of study; for when our words are good Latin,\nfull of meaning, elegant and aptly arranged, why\nshould we labour further And yet there are some\nwho are never weary of morbid self-criticism, who\nthrow themselves into an agony of mind almost\nover separate syllables, and even when they have discovered the best words for their purpose look for\nsome word that is older, less familiar, and less\nobvious, since they cannot bring themselves to\nrealise that when a speech is praised for its words,\nit implies that its sense is inadequate. While, then,\nstyle calls for the utmost attention, we must always\nbear in mind that nothing should be done for the\nsake of words only, since words were invented\nmerely to give expression to things and those\nwords are the most satisfactory which give the best\nexpression to the thoughts of our mind and produce\nthe effect which we desire upon the minds of the\njudges. Such words will assuredly be productive\nof a style that will both give pleasure and awaken\nadmiration; and the admiration will be of a kind\nfar other than that which we bestow on portents,\nwhile the pleasure evoked by the charm will have\nnothing morbid about it, but will be praiseworthy\nand dignified. I. What the Greeks call we in Latin call\nelocuio or style. Style is revealed both in individual\nwords and in groups of words. As regards the\nformer, we must see that they are Latin, clear, elegant\nand well-adapted to produce the desired effect. As\nregards the latter, they must be correct, aptly placed\nand adorned with suitable figures. I have already,\nin the portions of the first book dealing with the\nsubject of grammar, said all that is necessary on\nthe way to acquire idiomatic and correct speech.\nBut there my remarks were restricted to the prevention of positive faults, and it is well that I should\nnow point out that our words should have nothing\nprovincial or foreign about them. For you will find that there are a number of writers by no means\ndeficient in style whose language is precious rather\nthan idiomatic. As an illustration of my meaning\nI would remind you of the story of the old woman\nat Athens, who, when Theophrastus, a man of no\nmean eloquence, used one solitary word in an\naffected way, immediately said that he was a\nforeigner, and on being asked how she detected it,\nreplied that his language was too Attic for Athens.\nAgain Asinius Pollio held that Livy, for all his\nastounding eloquence, showed traces of the idiom\nof Padua. Therefore, if possible, our voice and all\nour words should be such as to reveal the native of\nthis city, so that our speech may seem to be of\ngenuine Roman origin, and not merely to have\nbeen presented with Roman citizenship. Clearness results above all from propriety in\nthe use of words. But propriety is capable of more\nthan one interpretation. In its primary sense it\nmeans calling things by their right names, and is\nconsequently sometimes to be avoided, for our\nlanguage must not be obscene, unseemly or mean.\nLanguage may be described as mean when it is\nbeneath the dignity of the subject or the rank of\nthe speaker. Some orators fall into serious error\nin their eagerness to avoid this fault, and are afraid\nof all words that are in ordinary use, even although\nthey may be absolutely necessary for their purpose.\nThere was, for example, the man who in the course\nof a speech spoke of a meaningless\nphrase intelligible only to himself. Cassius Severus,\nhowever, by way of deriding his affectation, explained\nthat he meant Spanish broom. Nor do I see why\na certain distinguished orator thought a more elegant phrase than the\nword which he avoided. But while there is no\nspecial merit in the form of propriety which consists\nin calling things by their real names, it is a fault\nto fly to the opposite extreme. This fault we call\nimpropriety, while the Greeks call it As\nexamples I may cite the Virgilian, or the phrase,\nwhich I noted had been corrected by Cicero in a\nspeech of Dolabella's, or again,\nphrases of a kind that win praise from some of\nour contemporaries, such as, On the other hand, everything that\nlacks appropriateness will not necessarily suffer from\nthe fault of positive impropriety, because there are, in\nthe first place, many things which have no proper\nterm either in Greek or Latin. For example, the\nverb iaculari is specially used in the sense of whereas there is no special verb\nappropriated to the throwing of a ball or a stake.\nSo, too, while lapidare has the obvious meaning of there is no special word to describe\nthe throwing of clods or potsherds. Hence abuse or\ncatachresis of words becomes necessary, while metaphor, also, which is the supreme ornament of oratory,\napplies words to things with which they have\nstrictly no connexion. Consequently propriety turns\nnot on the actual term, but on the meaning of the\nterm, and must be tested by the touchstone of the\nunderstanding, not of the ear. The second sense\nin which the word propriety is used occurs when\nthere are a number of things all called by the same\nname in this case the original term from which\nthe others are derived is styled the proper term. For example, the word vertex means a whirl of\nwater, or of anything else that is whirled in a like\nmanner then, owing to the fashion of coiling the\nhair, it comes to mean the top of the head, while\nfinally, from this sense it derives the meaning of\nthe highest point of a mountain. All these things\nmay correctly be called vertices, but the proper use\nof the term is the first. So, too, solea and tuidus\nare employed as names of fish, to mention no other\ncases. The third kind of propriety is found in\nthe case where a thing which serves a number\nof purposes has a special name in some one particular context; for example, the proper term for\na funeral song is naenia, and for the general's tent\naugurale. Again, a term which is common to a\nnumber of things may be applied in a proper or\nspecial sense to some one of them. Thus we use\nurbs in the special sense of Rome, venales in the\nspecial sense of newly-purchased slaves, and Corinthia in the special sense of bronzes, although\nthere are other cities besides Rome, and many\nother things which may be styled venales besides\nslaves, and gold and silver are found at Corinth\nas well as bronze. But the use of such terms\nimplies no special excellence in an orator. There\nis, however, a form of propriety of speech which\ndeserves the highest praise, that is to say, the\nemployment of words with the maximum of significance, as, for instance, when Cato said that or as\nVirgil spoke of a and Horace\nof the and Some\nalso include under this head that form of propriety which is derived from characteristic epithets,\nsuch as in the Virgilian phrases, or But of\nthis sort of propriety I shall have to speak elsewhere. Propriety is also made to include the appropriate use of words in metaphor, while at times the\nsalient characteristic of an individual comes to be\nattached to him as a proper name thus Fabius was\ncalled the Delayer, on account of the\nmost remarkable of his many military virtues. Some,\nperhaps, may think that words which mean more\nthan they actually say deserve mention in connexion\nwith clearness, since they assist the understanding.\nI, however, prefer to place emphasis among the\nornaments of oratory, since it does not make a thing\nintelligible, but merely more intelligible. Obscurity, on the other hand, results from the\nemployment of obsolete words, as, for instance, if\nan author should search the records of the priests,\nthe earliest treaties and the works of long-forgotten\nwriters with the deliberate design of collecting\nwords that no man living understands. For there\nare persons who seek to gain a reputation for erudition by such means as this, in order that they\nmay be regarded as the sole depositories of certain\nforms of knowledge. Obscurity may also be produced by the use of words which are more familiar\nin certain districts than in others, or which are\nof a technical character, such as the wind called or a or in malo cosanum.\nSuch expressions should be avoided if we are pleading before a judge who is ignorant of their meaning,\nor, if used, should be explained, as may have to be\ndone in the case of what are called homonyms. For example, the word taurus may be unintelligible unless we make it clear whether we are speaking of\na bull, or a mountain, or a constellation, or the name\nof a man, or the root of a tree. A greater source of obscurity is, however, to be\nfound in the construction and combination of words,\nand the ways in which this may occur are still more\nnumerous. Therefore, a sentence should never be\nso long that it is impossible to follow its drift, nor\nshould its conclusion be unduly postponed by transposition or an excessive use of hyperbaton. Still\nworse is the result when the order of the words is\nconfused as in the line Again, parenthesis, so often employed by orators\nand historians, and consisting in the insertion of one\nsentence in the midst of another, may seriously\nhinder the understanding of a passage, unless the\ninsertion is short. For example, in the passage\nwhere Vergil describes a colt, the words are followed by a number of remarks of a totally\ndifferent form, and it is only four lines later that\nthe poet returns to the point and says, Above all, ambiguity must be avoided, and by\nambiguity I mean not merely the kind of which\nI have already spoken, where the sense is uncertain,\nas in the clause Chremetem audivi percussisse Demean, but also that form of ambiguity which, although\nit does not actually result in obscuring the sense,\nfalls into the same verbal error as if a man should say\nvisum a se hominem librum scribentem that he had\nseen a man writing a book. For although it is\nclear that the book was being written by the man,\nthe sentence is badly put together, and its author\nhas made it as ambiguous as he could. Again, some writers introduce a whole host of\nuseless words; for, in their eagerness to avoid\nordinary methods of expression, and allured by\nfalse ideals of beauty they wrap up everything in a\nmultitude of words simply and solely because they\nare unwilling to make a direct and simple statement of the facts and then they link up and\ninvolve one of those long-winded clauses with others\nlike it, and extend their periods to a length beyond\nthe compass of mortal breath. Some even expend\nan infinity of toil to acquire this vice, which, by the\nway, is nothing new for I learn from the pages of\nLivy that there was one, a teacher, who instructed\nhis pupils to make all they said obscure, using the\nGreek word  It was this\nsame habit that gave rise to the famous words of\npraise, Others are consumed with a\npassion for brevity and omit words which are\nactually necessary to the sense, regarding it as a\nmatter of complete indifference whether their meaning is intelligible to others, so long as they know\nwhat they mean themselves. For my own part, I\nregard as useless words which make such a demand\nupon the ingenuity of the hearer. Others, again,\nsucceed in committing the same fault by a perverse misuse of figures. Worst of all are the\nphrases which the Greeks call that is to\nsay, expressions which, though their meaning is\nobvious enough on the surface, have a secret meaning, as for example in the phrase cum ductus est\ncaecus secundam viam stare, or where the man, who\nis supposed in the scholastic theme to have torn his\nown limbs with his teeth, is said to have lain upon\nhimself Such expressions are regarded as ingenious,\ndaring and eloquent, simply because of their ambiguity, and quite a number of persons have become\ninfected by the belief that a passage which requires\na commentator must for that very reason be a\nmasterpiece of elegance. Nay, there is even a class\nof hearer who find a special pleasure in such passages; for the fact that they can provide an answer\nto the riddle fills them with an ecstasy of self-congratulation, as if they had not merely heard the\nphrase, but invented it. For my own part, I regard clearness as the first\nessential of a good style there must be propriety\nin our words, their order must be straightforward,\nthe conclusion of the period must not be long postponed, there must be nothing lacking and nothing\nsuperfluous. Thus our language will be approved\nby the learned and clear to the uneducated. I am\nspeaking solely of clearness in style, as I have\nalready dealt with clearness in the presentation\nof facts in the rules I laid down for the statement\nof the case. But the general method is the same\nin both. For if what we say is not less nor more\nthan is required, and is clear and systematically\narranged, the whole matter will be plain and obvious\neven to a not too attentive audience. For we must never forget that the attention of the judge is not\nalways so keen that he will dispel obscurities without assistance, and bring the light of his intelligence\nto bear on the dark places of our speech. On the\ncontrary, lie will have many other thoughts to distract him unless what we say is so clear that our\nwords will thrust themselves into his mind even\nwhen he is not giving us his attention, just as the\nsunlight forces itself upon the eyes. Therefore\nour aim must be not to put him in a position\nto understand our argument, but to force him to\nunderstand it. Consequently we shall frequently\nrepeat anything which we think the judge has\nfailed to take in as he should. We shall say, for\nexample, ; for the pretended admission of a fault\non our part creates an excellent impression. I now come to the subject of ornament, in\nwhich, more than in any other department, the orator\nundoubtedly allows himself the greatest indulgence.\nFor a speaker wins but trifling praise if he does no\nmore than speak with correctness and lucidity; in\nfact his speech seems rather to be free from blemish\nthan to have any positive merit. Even the untrained often possess the gift of invention, and no\ngreat learning need be assumed for the satisfactory\narrangement of our matter, while if any more\nrecondite art is required, it is generally concealed,\nsince unconcealed it would cease to be an art, while\nall these qualities are employed solely to serve the\ninterests of the actual case. On the other hand, by\nthe employment of skilful ornament the orator commends himself at the same time, and whereas his\nother accomplishments appeal to the considered\njudgment of the learned, this gift appeals to the\nenthusiastic approval of the world at large, and the\nspeaker who possesses it fights not merely with\neffective, but with flashing weapons. If in his defence\nof Cornelius Cicero had confined himself merely to\ninstructing the judge and speaking in clear and idiomatic Latin without a thought beyond the interests\nof his case, would he ever have compelled the Roman\npeople to proclaim their admiration not merely by\nacclamation, but by thunders of applause No, it\nwas the sublimity and splendour, the brilliance and\nthe weight of his eloquence that evoked such clamorous enthusiasm. Nor, again, would his words have\nbeen greeted with such extraordinary approbation if\nhis speech had been like the ordinary speeches of\nevery day. In my opinion the audience did not know\nwhat they were doing, their applause sprang neither\nfrom their judgment nor their will; they were seized\nwith a kind of frenzy and, unconscious of the place in\nwhich they stood, burst forth spontaneously into a\nperfect ecstasy of delight. But rhetorical ornament contributes not a little to\nthe furtherance of our case as well. For when our\naudience find it a pleasure to listen, their attention\nand their readiness to believe what they hear are\nboth alike increased, while they are generally filled\nwith delight, and sometimes even transported by\nadmiration. The flash of the sword in itself strikes\nsomething of terror to the eye, and we should be\nless alarmed by the thunderbolt if we feared its\nviolence alone, and not its flash as well. Cicero\nwas right when, in one of his letters to Brutus, he wrote, Aristotle\nlikewise thinks that the excitement of admiration\nshould be one of our first aims. But such ornament must, as I have already said,\nbe bold, manly and chaste, free from all effeminate\nsmoothness and the false hues derived from artificial\ndyes, and must glow with health and vigour. So true\nis this, that although, where ornament is concerned,\nvice and virtue are never far apart, those who employ\na vicious style of embellishment disguise their vices\nwith the name of virtue. Therefore let none of our\ndecadents accuse me of being an enemy to those\nwho speak with grace and finish. I do not deny the\nexistence of such a virtue, I merely deny that they\npossess it. Shall I regard a farm as a model of good\ncultivation because its owner shows me lilies and\nviolets and anemones and fountains of living water\nin place of rich crops and vines bowed beneath their\nclusters Shall I prefer the barren plane and myrtles\ntrimly clipped, to the fruitful olive and the elm that\nweds the vine No, let such luxuries delight the rich\nbut where would their wealth be if they had nought\nsave theseAgain, is beauty an object of no consideration in the planting of fruit trees Certainly\nnot For my trees must be planted in due order\nand at fixed intervals. What fairer sight is there\nthan rows of trees planted in chelon which present\nstraight lines to the eye from whatever angle they be\nviewed But it has an additional advantage, since\nthis form of plantation enables every tree to derive\nan equal share of moisture from the soil. When the\ntops of my olive trees rise too high, I lop them away,\nwith the result that their growth expands laterally in a manner that is at once more pleasing to the eye\nand enables them to bear more fruit owing to the\nincrease in the number of branches. A horse whose\nflanks are compact is not only better to look upon,\nbut swifter in speed. The athlete whose muscles\nhave been formed by exercise is a joy to the eye, but\nhe is also better fitted for the contests in which he\nmust engage. In fact true beauty and usefulness\nalways go hand in hand. It does not, however, require any special ability to\ndiscern the truth of this. It is more important to\nnote that such seemly ornament must be varied to\nsuit the nature of the material to which it is applied.\nTo begin with the primary classification of oratory,\nthe same form of ornament will not suit demonstrative, deliberative and forensic speeches. For the\noratory of display aims solely at delighting the\naudience, and therefore develops all the resources of\neloquence and deploys all its ornament, since it seeks\nnot to steal its way into the mind nor to wrest the\nvictory from its opponent, but aims solely at honour\nand glory. Consequently the orator, like the hawker\nwho displays his wares, will set forth before his\naudience for their inspection, nay, almost for their\nhandling, all his most attractive reflexions, all the\nbrilliance that language and the charm that figures\ncan supply, together with all the magnificence of\nmetaphor and the elaborate art of composition that\nis at his disposal. For his success concerns himself,\nand not his cause. But when it is a question of facts,\nand he is confronted by the hard realities of battle,\nhis last thought will be for his personal glory. Nay,\nit is even unseemly to trouble overmuch about words\nwhen the greatest interests are at stake. I would not assert that such themes afford no scope for\nornament, but such ornament as is employed must\nbe of a more severe, restrained and less obvious\ncharacter; above all, it must be adapted to the\nmatter in hand. For whereas in deliberative oratory\nthe senate demand a certain loftiness and the people\na certain impetuosity of eloquence, the public cases\nof the courts and those involving capital punishment\ndemand a more exact style. On the other hand, in\nprivate deliberations and lawsuits about trifling sums\nof money and there are not a few of these it is more\nappropriate to employ simple and apparently unstudied language. For we should be ashamed to\ndemand the repayment of a loan in rolling periods, or\nto display poignant emotion in a case concerned with\nwater-droppings, or to work ourselves into a perspiration over the return of a slave to the vendor.\nBut I am wandering from the point. Since rhetorical ornament, like clearness, may\nreside either in individual words or groups of words,\nwe must consider the requirements of both cases.\nFor although tile canon, that clearness mainly\nrequires propriety of language and ornament the\nskilful use of metaphor, is perfectly sound, it is\ndesirable that we should realise that without propriety ornament is impossible. But as several words\nmay often have the same meaning they are called\nsynonyms, some will be more distinguished, sublime, brilliant, attractive or euphonious than others.\nFor as those syllables are the most pleasing to the\near which are composed of the more euphonious\nletters, thus words composed of such syllables will\nsound better than others, and the more vowel sounds\nthey contain the more attractive they will be to hear. The same principle governs the linking of word with\nword; some arrangements will sound better than\nothers. But words require to be used in different\nways. For example, horrible things are best described by words that are actually harsh to the\near. But as a general rule it may be laid down\nthat the best words, considered individually, are\nthose which are fullest or most agreeable in sound.\nAgain, elegant words are always to be preferred\nto those which are coarse, and there is no room\nfor low words in the speech of a cultivated man.\nThe choice of striking or sublime words will be\ndetermined by the matter in hand; for a word that\nin one context is magnificent may be turgid in\nanother, and words which are all too mean to\ndescribe great things may be suitable enough when\napplied to subjects of less importance. And just as\na mean word embedded in a brilliant passage\nattracts special attention, like a spot on a bright\nsurface, so if our style be of a plain character,\nsublime and brilliant words will seem incongruous\nand tasteless excrescences on a flat surface. In\nsome cases instinct, and not reason, must supply\nthe touchstone, as, for example, in the line Here the poet, by inventing the word porca, succeeded in producing an elegant impression, whereas\nif lie had used the masculine porcuis, the very reverse\nwould have been the case. In some cases, however,\nthe incongruity is obvious enough. It was only the\nother day that we laughed with good reason at the\npoet who wrote On the other hand, we admire Virgil when he\nsays For here the epithet is appropriate and prevents\nour expecting too much, while the use of the singular\ninstead of the plural, and the unusual monosyllabic\nconclusion of the line, both add to the pleasing effect.\nHorace accordingly imitated Virgil in both these\npoints, when he wrote, Again, our style need not always dwell on the\nheights at times it is desirable that it should sink.\nFor there are occasions when the very meanness of\nthe words employed adds force to what we say.\nWhen Cicero, in his denunciation of Piso, says, do\nyou think that his use of the word dray was accidental,\nand was not designedly used to increase his audience's\ncontempt for the man he wished to bring to ruin\nThe same is true when he says elsewhere, This device may also\nserve to carry off a jest, as in the passage of Cicero\nwhere he talks of the or where he speaks of or, again, in the\npro Milone, cries, and talks of On the other hand, this\npractice becomes more obtrusive when employed in\nthe schools, like the phrase that was so much\npraised in my boyhood, or\nin the same declamation, But such tricks do not always come off, especially in the schools, and often turn the laugh against the\nspeaker, particularly in the present day, when declamation has become so far removed from reality\nand labours under such an extravagant fastidiousness\nin the choice of words that it has excluded a good\nhalf of the language from its vocabulary. Words are proper, newly-coined or metaphorical. In\nthe case of proper words there is a special dignity\nconferred by antiquity, since old words, which not\neveryone would think of using, give our style a\nvenerable and majestic air this is a form of ornament\nof which Virgil, with his perfect taste, has made\nunique use. For his employment of words such as\nolli, quianam, moerus, pone and pellacia gives his\nwork that impressive air of antiquity which is so\nattractive in pictures, but which no art of man can\ncounterfeit. But we must not overdo it, and such\nwords must not be dragged out from the deepest\ndarkness of the past. Quaeso is old enough what\nneed for us to say quaiso Oppido was still used by\nmy older contemporaries, but I fear that no one\nwould tolerate it now. At any rate, antegerio, which\nmeans the same, would certainly never be used by\nanyone who was not possessed with a passion for\nnotoriety. What need have we of acrumnosum It\nis surely enough to call a thing horridum. Reor may\nbe tolerated, autumo smacks of tragedy, proles has\nbecome a rarity, while prosapia stamps the man\nwho uses it as lacking taste. Need I say more\nAlmost the whole language has changed. But there\nare still some old words that are endeared to us by their antique sheen, while there are others that we\ncannot avoid using occasionally, such, for example, as\nnuncupare and fari there are yet others which it\nrequires some daring to use, but which may still be\nemployed so long as we avoid all appearance of that\naffectation which Virgil has derided so cleverly This was a certain Cimber who killed his brother,\na fact which Cicero recorded in the words, The epigram against Sallust is scarcely less well\nknown It is a tiresome kind of affectation; any one can\npractise it, and it is made all the worse by the fact\nthat the man who catches the infection will not\nchoose his words to suit his facts, but will drag in\nirrelevant facts to provide an opportunity for the use\nof such words. The coining of new words is, as I stated in the\nfirst book, more permissible in Greek, for the\nGreeks did not hesitate to coin nouns to represent\ncertain sounds and emotions, and in truth they were\ntaking no greater liberty than was taken by the\nfirst men when they gave names to things. Our\nown writers have ventured on a few attempts at\ncomposition and derivation, but have not met with much success. I remember in my young days there\nwas a dispute between Pomponius and Seneca which\neven found its way into the prefaces of their works,\nas to whether gradus eliminate was a phrase which\nought to have been allowed in tragedy. But the\nancients had no hesitation about using even expectorate\nand, after all, it presents exactly the same formation\nas exanimat. Of the coining of words by expansion\nand inflexion we have examples, such as the Ciceronian beatitas and beatitudo, forms which he feels to\nbe somewhat harsh, though he thinks they may be\nsoftened by use. Derivatives may even be fashioned\nfrom proper names, quite apart from ordinary words,\nwitness Sullaturit in Cicero and Fimbriatus and Figulatus in Asinius. Many new words have been\ncoined in imitation of the Greeks, more especially\nby Verginius Flavus, some of which, such as queens and\nessentia, are regarded as unduly harsh. But I see no\nreason why we should treat them with such contempt,\nexcept, perhaps, that we are highly self-critical and\nsuffer in consequence from the poverty of our\nlanguage. Some new formations do, however, succeed\nin establishing themselves. For words which now\nare old, once were new, and there are some words in\nuse which are of quite recent origin, such as reatus,\ninvented by Messala, and munerarius, invented by\nAugustus. So, too, my own teachers still persisted\nin banning the use of words, such as piratica, musica\nand fabrica, while Cicero regards favor and urbanus\nas but newly introduced into the language. For in\na letter to Brutus he says, eum amorer et eum, ut hoc verbo utar, favored in consilium advocabo, while to\nAppius Pulcher he writes, le hominem non solum sapientem, verum etiam, ut nunc loquimur, urbanum. He\nalso thinks that Terence was the first to use the\nword obsequium, while Caecilius asserts that Sisenna\nwas the first to use the phrase albente caelo. Hortensius seems to have been the first to use cervix in\nthe singular, since the ancients confined themselves\nto the plural. We must not then be cowards, for I\ncannot agree with Celsus when he forbids orators to\ncoin new words. For some words, as Cicero says,\nare native, that is to say, are used in their original\nmeaning, while others are derivative, that is to say,\nformed from the native. Granted then that we\nare not justified in coining entirely new words\nhaving no resemblance to the words invented by\nprimitive man, I must still ask at what date we were\nfirst forbidden to form derivatives and to modify\nand compound words, processes which were undoubtedly permitted to later generations of mankind.\nIf, however, one of our inventions seems a little\nrisky, we must take certain measures in advance to\nsave it from censure, prefacing it by phrases such as or The same practice may be followed in the\ncase of bold metaphors, and it is not too much to\nsay that almost anything can be said with safety\nprovided we show by the very fact of our anxiety\nthat the word or phrase in question is not due to an\nerror of judgment. The Greeks have a neat saying\non this subject, advising us to be the first to blame\nour own hyperbole. The metaphorical use of words cannot be recommended except in connected discourse. Enough has\nnow been said on the subject of single words, which,\nas I have pointed out elsewhere, have no intrinsic\nvalue of their own. On the other hand, there is no\nword which is intrinsically ugly unless it be beneath\nthe dignity of the subject on which we have to\nspeak, excepting always such words as are nakedly\nobscene. I would commend this remark to those\nwho do not think it necessary to avoid obscenity on\nthe ground that no word is indecent in itself and\nthat, if a thing is revolting, its unpleasantness will\nbe realised clearly enough by whatever name it is\ncalled. Accordingly, I shall content myself with\nfollowing the good old rules of Roman modesty and,\nas I have already replied to such persons, shall\nvindicate the cause of decency by saying no more on\nthis unpleasant subject. Let us now pass to consider connected discourse.\nIts adornment may be effected, primarily, in two\nways; that is to say, we must consider first our ideal\nof style, and secondly how we shall express this ideal\nin actual words. The first essential is to realise\nclearly what we wish to enhance or attenuate, to\nexpress with vigour or calm, in luxuriant or austere\nlanguage, at length or with conciseness, with gentleness or asperity, magnificence or subtlety, gravity or\nwit. The next essential is to decide by what kind of\nmetaphor, figures, reflexions, methods and arrangement we may best produce the effect which we\ndesire. But, before I discuss ornament, I must first touch\nupon its opposite, since the first of all virtues is the\navoidance of faults. Therefore we must not expect\nany speech to be ornate that is not, in the first place, acceptable. An acceptable style is defined by\nCicero as one which is not over-elegant not that\nour style does not require elegance and polish,\nwhich are essential parts of ornament, but that excess\nis always a vice. He desires, therefore, that our\nwords should have a certain weight about them, and\nthat our thoughts should be of a serious cast or, at\nany rate, adapted to the opinions and character of\nmankind. These points once secured, we may\nproceed to employ those expressions which he\nregards as conferring distinction on style, that is to\nsay, specially selected words and phrases, metaphor,\nhyperbole, appropriate epithets, repetitions, synonyms and all such language as may suit our case and\nprovide an adequate representation of the facts. But since my first task is to point out the faults to\nbe avoided, I will begin by calling attention to the\nfault known as a term applied to the\nemployment of language to which perverted usage\nhas given an obscene meaning take, for example,\nphrases such as ductare exercitus and patrare bellum,\nwhich were employed by Sallust in their old and\nirreproachable sense, but, I regret to say, cause\namusement in certain quarters to-day. This, however, is not, in my opinion, the fault of the writer, but\nof his readers; still it is one to be avoided, for we\nhave perverted the purity of language by our own\ncorruption, and there is no course left to us but to\ngive ground before the victorious advance of vice.\nThe same term is also applied in the cases where an\nunfortunate collocation of words produces an obscene\nsuggestion. For example, in the phrase cum hominibus notis loqui, unless hominibus is placed between cum\nand notis, we shall commit ourselves to a phrase which will require some apology, since the final letter\nof the first syllable, which cannot be pronounced\nwithout closing the lips, will force us either to pause\nin a most unbecoming manner, or by assimilation to\nthe n which follows will produce a most objectionable suggestion. I might quote other collocations\nof words which are liable to the same objection, but\nto discuss them in detail would be to fall into that\nvery fault which I have just said should be avoided.\nA similar offence against modesty may be caused by\nthe division of words, as, for example, by the use of\nthe nominative of intercapedinis. And it is not\nmerely in writing that this may occur, but you will\nfind, unless you exercise the greatest care, that there\nare a number of persons who take pleasure in putting\nan indecent interpretation on words, thinking, as\nOvid says Nay, an obscene meaning may be extracted even\nfrom words which are as far removed from indecency\nas possible. Celsus, for example, detects an instance\nof in the Virgilian phrase but if this point of view be accepted, it will be risky\nto say anything at all. Next to indecency of expression comes meanness,\nstyled when the grandeur or dignity of\nanything is diminished by the words used, as in the\nline The opposite fault, which is no less serious, consists in calling small things by extravagant names, though\nsuch a practice is permissible when deliberately\ndesigned to raise a laugh. Consequently we must\nnot call a parricide a scamp, nor a man who keeps a\nharlot a villain, since the first epithet is too weak\nand the second too strong. This fault will result in\nmaking our language dull, or coarse, jejune, heavy,\nunpleasing or slovenly, all of which faults are best\nrealised by reference to the virtues which are their\nopposites, that is, point, polish, richness, liveliness,\ncharm, and finish. We must also avoid a term applied to\nmeagreness and inadequacy of expression, although\nit is a fault which characterises an obscure style rather\nthan one which lacks ornament. But meiosis may be\ndeliberately employed, and is then called a figure,\nas also is tautology, which means the repetition of a\nword or phrase. The latter, though not avoided\nwith special care even by the best authors, may\nsometimes be regarded as a fault it is, in fact, a\nblemish into which Cicero not infrequently falls\nthrough indifference to such minor details take, for\nexample, the following passage, It is sometimes given another name, under\nwhich appellation it is ranked among figures, of\nwhich I shall give examples when I come to the\ndiscussion of stylistic virtues. A worse fault is or sameness, a term\napplied to a style which has no variety to relieve\nits tedium, and which presents a uniform monotony\nof hue. This is one of the surest signs of lack of art,\nand produces a uniquely unpleasing effect, not merely\non the mind, but on the ear, on account of its sameness of thought, the uniformity of its figures, and\nthe monotony of its structure. We must also avoid\nmacrology, that is, the employment of more words\nthan are necessary, as, for instance, in the sentence\nof Livy, On the other hand, periphrasis, which is akin to this\nblemish, is regarded as a virtue. Another fault is\npleonasm, when we overload our style with a superfluity of words, as in the phrase, where would have been\nsufficient. Cicero passed a witty comment on a\nfault of this kind in a declamation of Hirtius when\nhe said that a child had been carried for ten months\nin his mother's womb. he said, Sometimes, however, the form of pleonasm, of which I\nhave just given an example, may have a pleasing\neffect when employed for the sake of emphasis, as\nin the Virgilian phrase But whenever the addition is not deliberate, but\nmerely tame and redundant, it must be regarded as\na fault. There is also a fault entitled which\nI may perhaps translate by superfluous elaboration,\nwhich differs from its corresponding virtue much as\nfussiness differs from industry, and superstition from\nreligion. Finally, every word which neither helps\nthe sense nor the style may be regarded as faulty. Cacozelia, or perverse affectation, is a fault in every\nkind of style for it includes all that is turgid,\ntrivial, luscious, redundant, far-fetched or extravagant, while the same name is also applied to virtues carried to excess, when the mind loses its critical\nsense and is misled by the false appearance of\nbeauty, the worst of all offences against style, since\nother faults are due to carelessness, but this is\ndeliberate. This form of affectation, however, affects\nstyle alone. For the employment of arguments which\nmight equally well be advanced by the other side,\nor are foolish, inconsistent or superfluous, are all\nfaults of matter, whereas corruption of style is\nrevealed in the employment of improper or redundant\nwords, in obscurity of meaning, effeminacy of rhythm,\nor in the childish search for similar or ambiguous\nexpressions. Further, it always involves insincerity,\neven though all insincerity does not imply affectation.\nFor it consists in saying something in an unnatural\nor unbecoming or superfluous manner. Style may,\nhowever, be corrupted in precisely the same number\nof ways that it may be adorned. But I have discussed this subject at greater length in another\nwork, and have frequently called attention to it in\nthis, while I shall have occasion to mention it continually in the remaining books. For in dealing with\nornament, I shall occasionally speak of faults which\nhave to be avoided, but which are hard to distinguish\nfrom virtues. To these blemishes may be added faulty arrangement or the faulty use of figures or and the faulty collocation of words\nor But, as I have already discussed\narrangement, I will confine myself to the consideration of figures and structure. There is also a fault\nknown as which consists in the indiscriminate use of several different dialects, as, for\ninstance, would result from mixing Doric, Ionic, and even Aeolic words with Attic. A similar fault is\nfound amongst ourselves, consisting in the indiscriminate mixture of grand words with mean, old\nwith new, and poetic with colloquial, the result\nbeing a monstrous medley like that described by\nHorace in the opening portion of his Ars poetica, and, be proceeds to say, should add other limbs from\ndifferent animals. The ornate is something that goes beyond what\nis merely lucid and acceptable. It consists firstly\nin forming a clear conception of what we wish to\nsay, secondly in giving this adequate expression,\nand thirdly in lending it additional brilliance, a\nprocess which may correctly be termed embellishment. Consequently we must place among ornaments\nthat which I mentioned in the rules which\nI laid down for the statement of facts, because vivid\nillustration, or, as some prefer to call it, representation, is something more than mere clearness, since\nthe latter merely lets itself be seen, whereas the\nformer thrusts itself upon our notice. It is a great\ngift to be able to set forth the facts on which\nwe are speaking clearly and vividly. For oratory\nfails of its full effect, and does not assert itself\nas it should, if its appeal is merely to the hearing,\nand if the judge merely feels that the facts\non which he has to give his decision are being\nnarrated to him, and not displayed in their living\ntruth to the eyes of the mind. But since different\nviews have been held with regard to this art of\nrepresentation, I shall not attempt to divide it into all its different departments, whose number is\nostentatiously multiplied by certain writers, but\nshall content myself with touching on those which\nappear to me to be absolutely necessary. There is,\nthen, to begin with, one form of vividness which consists in giving an actual word-picture of a scene, as\nin the passage beginning, Other details follow which give us such a picture\nof the two boxers confronting each other for the\nfight, that it could not have been clearer had we\nbeen actual spectators. Cicero is supreme in this\ndepartment, as in others. Is there anybody so incapable of forming a mental picture of a scene that,\nwhen he reads the following passage from the\nVerrines, he does not seem not merely to see the\nactors in the scene, the place itself and their very\ndress, but even to imagine to himself other details\nthat the orator does not describe For my own\npart, I seem to see before my eyes his face, his eyes,\nthe unseemly blandishments of himself and his paramour, the silent loathing and frightened shame of\nthose who viewed the scene. At times, again, the\npicture which we endeavour to present is fuller in\ndetail, as, for example, in the following description\nof a luxurious banquet, which is also from Cicero,\nsince he by himself is capable of supplying admirable\nexamples of every kind of oratorical ornament What more\nwould any man have seen who had actually entered\nthe room So, too, we may move our hearers to\ntears by the picture of a captured town. For the\nmere statement that the town was stormed, while\nno doubt it embraces all that such a calamity involves, has all the curtness of a dispatch, and fails\nto penetrate to the emotions of the hearer. But if\nwe expand all that the one word includes,\nwe shall see the flames pouring from house and\ntemple, and hear the crash of falling roofs and one\nconfused clamour blent of many cries we shall\nbehold some in doubt whither to fly, others clinging\nto their nearest and dearest in one last embrace,\nwhile the wailing of women and children and the\nlaments of old men that the cruelty of fate should\nhave spared them to see that day will strike upon\nour ears. Then will come the pillage of treasure\nsacred and profane, the hurrying to and fro of the\nplunderers as they carry off their booty or return to\nseek for more, the prisoners driven each before his\nown inhuman captor, the mother struggling to keep\nher child, and the victors fighting over the richest\nof the spoil. For though, as I have already said,\nthe sack of a city includes all these things, it is less\neffective to tell the whole news at once than to\nrecount it detail by detail. And we shall secure\nthe vividness we seek, if only our descriptions give\nthe impression of truth, nay, we may even add\nfictitious incidents of the type which commonly\noccur. The same vivid impression may be produced also by the mention of the accidents of each\nsituation or Though the attainment of such effects is, in my\nopinion, the highest of all oratorical gifts, it is far\nfrom difficult of attainment. Fix your eyes on nature\nand follow her. All eloquence is concerned with\nthe activities of life, while every man applies to\nhimself what he hears from others, and the mind\nis always readiest to accept what it recognises to\nbe true to nature. The invention of similes has also provided an\nadmirable means of illuminating our descriptions.\nSome of these are designed for insertion among\nour arguments to help our proof, while others are\ndevised to make our pictures yet more vivid; it is\nwith this latter class of simile that I am now specially\nconcerned. The following are good examples or In employing this form of ornament we must be\nespecially careful that the subject chosen for our\nsimile is neither obscure nor unfamiliar for anything that is selected for the purpose of illuminating something else must itself be clearer than that which\nit is designed to illustrate. Therefore while we may\npermit poets to employ such similes as it would be quite unsuitable for an orator to illustrate\nsomething quite plain by such obscure allusions.\nBut even the type of simile which I discussed in\nconnexion with arguments is an ornament to oratory,\nand serves to make it sublime, rich, attractive or\nstriking, as the case may be. For the more remote\nthe simile is from the subject to which it is applied,\nthe greater will be the impression of novelty and the\nunexpected which it produces. The following type\nmay be regarded as commonplace and useful only as\nhelping to create an impression of sincerity or Far finer is\nthe following from Cicero's defence of Archias and the rest. This type\nof simile has, however, sadly degenerated in the\nhands of some of our declaimers owing to the license\nof the schools. For they adopt false comparisons,\nand even then do not apply them as they should\nto the subjects to which they wish them to provide\na parallel. Both these faults are exemplified in\ntwo similes which were on the lips of everyone when I was a young man, and In every\ncomparison the simile either precedes or follows the\nsubject which it illustrates. But sometimes it is\nfree and detached, and sometimes, a far better\narrangement, is attached to the subject which it\nillustrates, the correspondence between the resemblances being exact, an effect produced by reciprocal\nrepresentation, which the Greeks style For example, the simile already quoted, precedes its subject. On the other hand, an example\nof the simile following its subject is to be found in\nthe first Georgic, where, after the long lamentation\nover the wars civil and foreign that have afflicted\nRome, there come the lines There is, however, no antapodosis in these similes.\nSuch reciprocal representation places both subjects of\ncomparison before our very eyes, displaying them\nside by side. Virgil provides many remarkable examples, but it will be better for me to quote from\noratory. In the pro Murena Cicero says, There is also another simile in the same\nspeech, which is almost worthy of a poet, but in\nvirtue of its reciprocal representation is better adapted\nfor ornament We find also\nshorter similes, such as or the passage from Cicero's\nspeech against Clodius Similar\nexamples from everyday speech will occur to\neveryone. Such comparisons reveal the gift not merely of\nplacing a thing vividly before the eye, but of doing\nso with rapidity and without waste of detail. The\npraise awarded to perfect brevity is well-deserved;\nbut, on the other hand, brachylogy, which I shall\ndeal with when I come to speak of figures, that is\nto say, the brevity that says nothing more than what\nis absolutely necessary, is less effective, although it\nmay be employed with admirable results when it\nexpresses a great deal in a very few words, as in\nSallust's description of Mithridates as But unsuccessful\nattempts to imitate this form of terseness result\nmerely in obscurity. A virtue which closely resembles the last, but\nis on a grander scale, is emphasis, which succeeds in revealing a deeper meaning than is actually\nexpressed by the words. There are two kinds of\nemphasis the one means more than it says, the\nother often means something which it does not\nactually say. An example of the former is found\nin Homer, where he makes Menelaus say that the\nGreeks descended into the Wooden Horse, indicating\nits size by a single verb. Or again, there is the\nfollowing example by Virgil a phrase which in a similar manner indicates the\nheight of the horse. The same poet, when he says\nthat the Cyclops lay stretched by taking the room occupied as the standard\nof measure, gives an impression of the giant's\nimmense bulk. The second kind of emphasis consists either in the complete suppression of a word\nor in the deliberate omission to utter it. As an\nexample of complete suppression I may quote the\nfollowing passage from the pro Ligario, 4 where\nCicero says Here he suppresses the fact, which is none the less clear enough\nto us, that he does not lack counsellors who would\nincite him to cruelty. The omission of a word is produced by aposiopesis, which, however, being a figure,\nshall be dealt with in its proper place. Emphasis is\nalso found in the phrases of every day, such as or or So like, as a rule, is nature to art. It is not, however, sufficient for eloquence to set forth its theme in brilliant and vivid language\nthere are many different ways of embellishing our\nstyle. For even that absolute and unaffected simplicity which the Greeks call has in it a\ncertain chaste ornateness such as we admire also in\nwomen, while a minute accuracy in securing propriety and precision in our words likewise produces\nan impression of neatness and delicacy. Again\ncopiousness may consist either in wealth of thought\nor luxuriance of language. Force, too, may be\nshown in different ways; for there will always be\nforce in anything that is in its own way effective.\nIts most important exhibitions are to be found in\nthe following or a certain sublimity in the\nexaggerated denunciation of unworthy conduct, to\nmention no other topics; or imagination,\nwhich assists us to form mental pictures of things; or finish, which produces completeness of\neffect; an intensified form of the preceding, which reasserts our proofs and clinches the\nargument by repetition; and or vigour, a\nnear relative of all these qualities, which derives\nits name from action and finds its peculiar function\nin securing that nothing that we say is tame.\nBitterness, which is generally employed in abuse,\nmay be of service as in the following passage.\nfrom Cassius Pungency also may be employed,\nas in the following remark of Crassus But the real power of\noratory lies in enhancing or attenuating the force of words. Each of these departments has the same\nnumber of methods; I shall touch on the more important; those omitted will be of a like character,\nwhile all are concerned either with words or things.\nI have, however, already dealt with the methods of\ninvention and arrangement, and shall therefore now\nconcern myself with the way in which style may\nelevate or depress the subject in hand. IV. The first method of amplification or attenuation\nis to be found in the actual word employed to\ndescribe a thing. For example, we may say that\na man who was beaten was murdered, or that a dishonest fellow is a robber, or, on the other hand, we\nmay say that one who struck another merely touched\nhim, and that one who wounded another merely hurt\nhim. The following passage from the pro Caelio,\nprovides examples of both For here he calls an immodest\nwoman a harlot, and says that one who had long\nbeen her lover saluted her with a certain freedom.\nThis sort of amplification may be strengthened\nand made more striking by pointing the comparison between words of stronger meaning and\nthose for which we propose to substitute them, as\nCicero does in denouncing Verres In this passage the\nfirst epithets are bad enough, but are rendered\nstill worse by those which follow. I consider,\nHowever, that there are four principal methods of\nimplication augmentation, comparison, reasoning and\naccumulation. Of these, augmentation is most impressive when it\nends grandeur even to comparative insignificance.\nThis may be effected either by one step or by\neveral, and may be carried not merely to the\nhighest degree, but sometimes even beyond it.\nA single example from Cicero will suffice to\nllustrate all these points. If he had\nmerely been scourged, we should have had but one\ntep, indicated by the description even of the lesser\noffence as a sin, while if he had merely been killed,\nwe should have had several more steps; but after\nsaying that it was and mentioning the worst of crimes, he adds, Consequently, since he had\nready exhausted his vocabulary of crime, words\nmust necessarily fail him to describe something still\norse. There is a second method of passing beond the highest degree, exemplified in Virgil's\ndescription of Lausus or here the words give us the superlative, on which\nthe poet proceeds to superimpose a still higher\ndegree. There is also a third sort, which is not\nattained by gradation, a height which is not a\ndegree beyond the superlative, but such that\nnothing greater can be conceived. For to make a thing so great as\nto be incapable of augmentation is in itself a kind\nof augmentation. It is also possible to heighten\nour style less obviously, but perhaps yet more effectively, by introducing a continuous and unbroken\nseries in which each word is stronger than the last,\nas Cicero does when he describes how Antony\nvomited Each phrase is more forcible than that\nwhich went before. Vomiting is an ugly thing in\nitself, even when there is no assembly to witness\nit; it is ugly when there is such an assembly, even\nthough it be not an assembly of the people; ugly\neven though it be an assembly of the people and\nnot the Roman people; ugly even though he were\nengaged on no business at the time, even if his\nbusiness were not public business, even if lie were\nnot Master of the Horse. Another might have\nbroken up the series and lingered over each step\nin the ascending scale, but Cicero hastens to his\nclimax and reaches the height not by laborious\neffort, but by the impetus of his speed. Just as this form of amplification rises to a climax,\nso, too, the form which depends on comparison seeks\nto rise from the less to the greater, since by raising\nwhat is below it must necessarily exalt that which is above, as, for example in the following passage Or take this\npassage from the speech against Catiline At times, again, we may advance a parallel\nto make something which we desire to exaggerate\nseem greater than ever, as Cicero does in the pro\nCluentio, where, after telling a story of a woman\nof Miletus who took a bribe from the reversionary\nheirs to prevent the birth of her expected child,\nlie cries, I would not, however,\nhave anyone think that this method is identical\nwith that used in argument, where the greater is\ninferred from the less, although there is a certain\nresemblance between the two. For in the latter\ncase we are aiming at proof, in the former at\namplification; for example, in the passage just cited\nabout Oppianicus, the object of the comparison is\nnot to show that his action was a crime, but that\nit was even worse than another crime. There is,\nhowever, a certain affinity between the two methods,\nand I will therefore repeata passage which I\nquoted there, although my present purpose is\ndifferent. For what I have now to demonstrate is\nthat when amplification is our purpose we compare not merely whole with whole, but part with\npart, as in the following passage Here\nCatiline is compared to Gracchus, the constitution\nof the state to the whole world, a slight change for\nthe worse to fire and sword and desolation, and a\nprivate citizen to the consuls, all comparisons\naffording ample opportunity for further individual\nexpansion, if anyone should desire so to do. With regard to the amplificalion produced by\nreasoning, we must consider whether reasoning quite\nexpresses my meaning. I am not a stickler for\nexact terminology, provided the sense is clear to\nany serious student. My motive in using this term\nwas, however, this, that this form of amplification\nproduces its effect at a point other than that where\nit is actually introduced. One thing is magnified\nin order to effect a corresponding augmentation elsewhere, and it is by reasoning that our hearers are\nthen led on from the first point to the second which\nwe desire to emplasise. Cicero, when he is about\nto reproach Antony with his drunkenness and\nvomiting, says, etc. What have his throat\nand flanks to do with his drunkenness The\nreference is far from pointless for by looking at\nthem we are enabled to estimate the quantity of the wine which he drank at Hippias' wedding, and\nwas unable to carry or digest in spite of the fact\nthat his bodily strength was worthy of a prizefighter. Accordingly if, in such a case, one thing is\ninferred from another, the term reasoning is neither\nimproper nor extraordinary, since it has been\napplied on similar grounds to one of the bases.\nSo, again, amplification results from subsequent\nevents, since the violence with which the wine\nburst from him was such that the vomiting was\nnot accidental nor voluntary, but a matter of\nnecessity, at a moment when it was specially unseemly, while the food was not recently swallowed,\nas is sometimes the case, but the residue of the revel\nof the preceding day. On the other hand, amplification may equally result from antecedent circumstances; for example, when Juno made her request\nto Aeolus, the latter whereby the poet shows what a mighty tempest will\nensue. Again, when we have depicted some horrible\ncircumstance in such colours as to raise the detestation of our audience to its height, we then proceed\nto make light of them in order that what is to follow\nmay seem still more horrible consider the following\npassage from Cicero Does not the orator employ a process of reasoning to\nenable the audience to infer how great the implied\ncrime must be when such actions were but humane\nand ordinary in comparison So, again, one thing\nmay be magnified by allusion to another the valour\nof Scipio is magnified by extolling the fame of\nHannibal as a general, and we are asked to marvel\nat the courage of the Germans and the Gauls in\norder to enhance the glory of Gaius Caesar. There\nis a similar form of amplification which is effected by\nreference to something which appears to have been\nsaid with quite another purpose in view. The chiefs\nof Troy think it no discredit that Trojan and Greek\nshould endure so many woes for so many years all\nfor the sake of Helen's beauty. How wondrous,\nthen, must her beauty have been For it is not\nParis, her ravisher, that says this; it is not some\nyouth or one of the common herd; no, it is the\nelders, the wisest of their folk, the counsellors of\nPriam. Nay, even the king himself, worn out by a\nten years' war, which had cost him the loss of so many\nof his sons, and threatened to lay his kingdom in the\ndust, the man who, above all, should have loathed\nand detested her beauty, the source of all those\ntears, hears these words, calls her his daughter, and\nplaces her by his side, excuses her guilt, and denies\nthat she is the cause of his sorrows. Again, when\nPlato in the Symposium makes Alcibiades confess\nhow he had wished Socrates to treat him, he does\nnot, I think, record these facts with a view to\nblaming Aleibiades, but rather to show the unconquerable self-control of Socrates, which would\nnot yield even to the charms which the greatest\nbeauty of his day so frankly placed at his disposal. We are even given the means of realising the\nextraordinary stature of the heroes of old by the\ndescription of their weapons, such as the shield of\nAjax and the spear-shaft of Achilles hewn in the\nforests of Pelion. Virgil also has made admirable\nuse of this device in his description of the Cyclops.\nFor what an image it gives us of the bulk of that\nbody So, too, what a giant must Demoleos have been,\nWhose And yet the hero buckled it upon him and And again, Cicero could hardly even have conceived of such luxury in Antony himself as he\ndescribes when he says, Slaves\nare using purple coverlets in their chambers, aye,\nand coverlets that had once been Pompey's No\nmore, surely, can be said than this, and yet it leaves\nus to infer how infinitely greater was the luxury of\ntheir master. This form of amplification is near akin\nto emphasis but emphasis derives its effect from\nthe actual words, while in this case the effect is\nproduced by inference from the facts, and is consequently far more impressive, inasmuch as facts are\nmore impressive than words. Accumulation of words and sentences identical in\nmeaning may also be regarded under the head of\namplification. For although the climax is not in\nthis case reached by a series of steps, it is none the\nless attained by the piling up of words. Take the\nfollowing example This passage recalls the figure\nstyled by the Greeks, but in that\nfigure it is a number of different things that are\naccumulated, whereas in this passage all the accumulated details have but one reference. The\nheightening of effect may also be produced by\nmaking the words rise to a climax. Attenuation is effected by the same method, since\nthere are as many degrees of descent as ascent.\nI shall therefore content myself with quoting but\none example, namely, the words used by Cicero to\ndescribe the speech of Rullus This passage may be regarded as providing an example of\nattenuation or of augmentation, according as we consider its literal meaning or fix our attention on the\nobscurity attributed to Rullus. I know that some may perhaps regard hyperbole\nas a species of amplification, since hyperbole can be employed to create an effect in either direction.\nBut as the name is also applied to one of the tropes,\nI must postpone its consideration for the present.\nI would proceed to the immediate discussion of this\nsubject but for the fact that others have given\nseparate treatment to this form of artifice, which\nemploys words not in their literal, but in a metaphorical sense. I shall therefore at this point\nindulge a desire now almost universal, and discuss\na form of ornament which many regard as the chief,\nnay, almost the sole adornment of oratory. V. When the ancients used the word sententia,\nthey meant a feeling, or opinion. The word is\nfrequently used in this sense by orators, and traces\nof this meaning are still found even in the speech\nof every day. For when we are going to take an\noath we use the phrase ex animi nostri sententia in\naccordance with what we hold is the solemn truth,\nand when we offer congratulations, we say that we do\nso ex sententia with all our heart. The ancients, indeed, often expressed the same meaning by saying\nthat they uttered their sensa; for they regarded\nsenses as referring merely to the senses of the body.\nBut modern usage applies sensus to concepts of the\nmind, while sentcntia is applied to striking reflexions\nsuch as are more especially introduced at the close\nof our periods, a practice rare in earlier days, but\ncarried even to excess in our own. Accordingly, I\nthink that I ought to say something of the various\nforms which such reflexions may tale and the manner\nin which they should be used. Although all the different forms are included\nunder the same name, the oldest type of sententia,\nand that in which the term is most correctly applied, is the aphorism, called by the Greeks. Both\nthe Greek and the Latin names are derived from\nthe fact that such utterances resemble the decrees\nor resolutions of public bodies. The term, however,\nis of wide application indeed, such reflexions may\nbe deserving of praise even when they have no\nreference to any special context, and is used in\nvarious ways. Sometimes it refers merely to things,\nas in the sentence Occasionally, again, they may have a\npersonal reference, as in the following utterance\nof Domitius Afer Some have called\nthis form of reflexion a part of the enthymeme, others\nthe major premise or conclusion of the epichireme, as\nit sometimes, though not invariably, is. More correct\nis the statement that at times it is simple, as in the\nexample just quoted, while at other times a reason\nfor the statement may be added, such as the following Sometimes, again, it may be double, as in\nthe statement that There are some even who classify them under ten\nheads, though the principle on which they make\nthis division is such that it would justify a still\nlarger number they class them as based on interrogation, comparison, denial, similarity, admiration,\nand the like, for they can be treated under every kind of figure. A striking type is that which is\nproduced by opposition Others are cast in a form of a direct statement,\nsuch as But they acquire greater force by a change in the\nfigure employed, as in the following For this is more vigorous than the simple statement, A similar effect may be produced by transference of' the statement from the\ngeneral to the particular. For example, although\nthe direct statement would be, Ovid gives this reflexion\nincreased force when lie makes Medea say, Cicero again gives the general statement a personal\nturn when he says For\nhere he attributes to Caesar what was really attributable to the circumstances of his power. In\nthis class of reflexion we must be careful, as always,\nnot to employ them too frequently, nor at random,\nnor place them in the mouth of every kind of person, while we must make certain that they are not\nuntrue, as is so often the case with those speakers\nwho style them reflexions of universal application and\nrecklessly employ whatever seems to support their\ncase as though its truth were beyond question.\nSuch reflexions are best suited to those speakers\nwhose authority is such that their character itself\nwill lend weight to their words. For who would\ntolerate a boy, or a youth, or even a man of low\nbirth who presumed to speak with all the authority\nof a judge and to thrust his precepts down our throats The term enthymeme may be applied to any concept\nof the mind, but in its strict sense means a reflexion\ndrawn from contraries. Consequently, it has a\nsupremacy among reflexions which we may compare to that of Homer among poets and Rome\namong cities. I have already said enough on this\ntopic in dealing with arguments. But the use of\nthe enthymeme is not confined to proof, it may sometimes be employed for the purpose of ornament, as\nin the following instance Cicero's\nmotive in saying this is not that it introduces any\nfresh reason for clemency, but because he has already\ndemonstrated by other arguments how unjust such\nconduct would be, while he adds it at the period's\nclose as an epiphonema, not by way of proof, but as\na crowning insult to his opponents. For an epiphonema\nis an exclamation attached to the close of a statement\nor a proof by way of climax. Here are two examples and There\nis also what our modern rhetoricians call the noema,\na term which may be taken to mean every kind of\nconception, but is employed by them in the special\nsense of things which they wish to be understood,\nthough they are not actually said, as in the declamation where the sister defends herself against the\nbrother whom she had often bought out from the\ngladiatorial school, when he brought an action\nagainst her demanding the infliction of a similar\nmutilation because she had cut off his thumb while\nhe slept she cries, meaning thereby, There is also what\nis called a clausula. If this merely means a conclusion, it is a perfectly correct and sometimes a\nnecessary device, as in the following case But to-day\nsomething more is meant, for our rhetoricians want\nevery passage, every sentence to strike the ear by\nan impressive close. In fact, they think it a disgrace, nay, almost a crime, to pause to breathe\nexcept at the end of a passage that is designed to\ncall forth applause. The result is a number of tiny\nepigrams, affected, irrelevant and disjointed. For\nthere are not enough striking reflexions in the world\nto provide a close to every period. The following forms of reflexion are even more\nmodern. There is the type which depends on surprise for its effect, as, for example, when Vibius\nCrispus, in denouncing the man who wore a breastplate when strolling in the forum and alleged that\nhe did so because he feared for his life, cried, Another\ninstance is the striking remark made by Africanus\nto Nero with reference to the death of Agrippina Others are of\nan allusive type for example, Domitius Afer, in his\ndefence of Cloatilla, whom Claudius had pardoned\nwhen she was accused of having buried her husband,\nwho had been one of the rebels, addressed her sons\nin his peroration with the words Some, again, depend on the fact that they are\ntransferred from one context to another Crispus,\nin his defence of Spatale, whose lover had made her\nhis heir and then proceeded to die at the age\nof eighteen, remarked Another type of reflexion may be produced by the doubling of a phrase,\nas in the letter written by Seneca for Nero to be sent\nto the senate on the occasion of his mother's death,\nwith a view to creating the impression that he had\nbeen in serious danger Better, however, is the\ntype which relies for its effect on contrast of opposites,\nas or, But to produce the most striking effect\nthis type should be given point by the introduction\nof a comparison, such as is made by Trachalus in his\nspeech against Spatale, where he says In these instances, however, the reflexion may\nequally well be good or bad. On the other hand,\nthere are some which will always be bad, such as\nthose which turn on play upon words, as in the\nfollowing case Worse still, as being more unreal\nand far-fetched, is the remark made by the gladiator\nmentioned above in his prosecution of his sister There is\nanother similar type, which is perhaps the worst of\nall, where the play upon words is combined with a\nfalse comparison. When I was a young man I heard\na distinguished pleader, after handing a mother some\nsplinters of bone taken from the head of her son\nwhich he did merely to provide an occasion for his\nepigram, cry Moreover, most of our orators delight in\ndevices of the pettiest kind, which seriously considered are merely ludicrous, but at the moment of\ntheir production flatter their authors by a superficial\nsemblance of wit. Take, for instance, the exclamation\nfrom the scholastic theme, where a man, after being\nruined by the barrenness of his land, is shipwrecked and hangs himself A\nsimilar absurdity is to be found in the declamation,\nto which I have already referred, in which a father\npoisons his son who insists on tearing his flesh with\nhis teeth Or again, take this passage from the\ntheme of the luxurious man who is alleged to have\npretended to starve himself to death Others are merely\nfatuous, such as the remark of the declaimer who\nurges the courtiers of Alexander to provide him with\na tomb by burning down Babylon. As if this were the climax of\nindignities Others fail from sheer extravagance.\nFor example, I once heard a rhetorician who was\ndeclaiming about the Germans, say and again when\nbelauding a hero, However, I shall never\ncome to an end if I try to describe every possible\nform of this kind of absurdity. I will therefore turn\nto discuss a point of more importance. Rhetoricians are divided in opinion on this subject\nsome devote practically all their efforts to the\nelaboration of reflexions, while others condemn their\nemployment altogether. I cannot agree entirely\nwith either view. If they are crowded too thick\ntogether, such reflexions merely stand in each other's\nway, just as in the case of crops and the fruits of\ntrees lack of room to grow results in a stunted\ndevelopment. Again in pictures a definite outline\nis required to throw objects into relief, and consequently artists who include a number of objects in\nthe same design separate them by intervals sufficient\nto prevent one casting a shadow on the other.\nFurther, this form of display breaks up our speeches\ninto a number of detached sentences; every reflexion\nis isolated, and consequently a fresh start is necessary\nafter each. This produces a discontinuous style, since our language is composed not of a system of limbs,\nbut of a series of fragments for your nicely rounded\nand polished phrases are incapable of cohesion.\nFurther, the colour, though bright enough, has no\nunity, but consists of a number of variegated splashes.\nA purple stripe appropriately applied lends brilliance\nto a dress, but a dress decorated with a quantity of\npatches can never be becoming to anybody. Wherefore, although these ornaments may seem to stand\nout with a certain glitter of their own, they are\nrather to be compared to sparks flashing through\nthe smoke than to the actual brilliance of flame\nthey are, in fact, invisible when the language is of\nuniform splendour, just as the stars are invisible in\nthe light of day. And where eloquence seeks to\nsecure elevation by frequent small efforts, it merely\nproduces an uneven and broken surface which fails\nto win the admiration due to outstanding objects\nand lacks the charm that may be found in a smooth\nsurface. To this must be added the fact that those\nwho devote themselves solely to the production of\nreflexions cannot avoid giving utterance to many that\nare trivial, flat or foolish. For their mere number\nwill so embarrass their author that selection will be\nimpossible. Consequently you will often find that\nsuch persons will produce a division or an argument as\nif it were an epigram, the only qualification necessary\nbeing that it should come toward the close of the\nperiod and be impressively delivered. Here we have a division. This is an argument. There are, moreover, a number of speakers\nwho not merely deliver many such epigrams, but\nutter everything as if it were an epigram. Against\nthese persons, on the other hand, must be set those\nwho shun and dread all ornament of this kind, approving nothing that is not plain, humble and effortless,\nwith the result that by their reluctance to climb for\nfear of falling they succeed merely in maintaining a\nperpetual flatness. What sin is there in a good\nepigram Does it not help our case, or move the\njudge, or commend the speaker to his audience\nIt may be urged, perhaps, that it is a form of\nornament eschewed by the ancients. What do you\nmean by antiquity If you go back to the earliest\nperiods you will find that Demosthenes frequently\nemployed methods that were known to none before\nhim. How can we give our approval to Cicero, if we\nthink that no change should be made from the\nmethods of Cato and the Gracchi And yet before\nthe Gracchi and Cato the style of oratory was simpler\nstill. For my own part I regard these particular\nornaments of oratory to be, as it were, the eyes of\neloquence. On the other hand, I should not like to\nsee the whole body full of eyes, for fear that it might\ncripple the functions of the other members, and, if I\nhad no alternative, I should prefer the rudeness of\nancient eloquence to the license of the moderns.\nBut a middle course is open to us here no less than\nin the refinements of dress and mode of life, where\nthere is a certain tasteful elegance that offends no\none. Therefore let us as far as possible seek to increase the number of our virtues, although our first\ncare must always be to keep ourselves free from\nvices, lest in seeking to make ourselves better than the ancients we succeed merely in making ourselves\nunlike them. I will now proceed to the next subject for discussion, which is, as I have said, that of tropes, or modes,\nas the most distinguished Roman rhetoricians call\nthem. Rules for their use are given by the teachers\nof literature as well. But I postponed the discussion\nof the subject when I was dealing with literary\neducation, because it seemed to me that the theme\nwould have greater importance if handled in connexion with the ornaments of oratory, and that it\nought to be reserved for treatment on a larger scale. By a trope is meant the artistic alteration of\na word or phrase from its proper meaning to another.\nThis is a subject which has given rise to interminable disputes among the teachers of literature, who\nhave quarrelled no less violently with the philosophers than among themselves over the problem of\nthe genera and species into which tropes may be\ndivided, their number and their correct classification.\nI propose to disregard such quibbles as in no wise\nconcern the training of an orator, and to proceed\nto discuss those tropes which are most necessary and\nmeet with most general acceptance, contenting\nmyself merely with noting the fact that some tropes\nare employed to help out our meaning and others to\nadorn our style, that some arise from words used\nproperly and others from words used metaphorically,\nand that the changes involved concern not merely\nindividual words, but also our thoughts and the\nstructure of our sentences. In view of these facts\nI regard those writers as mistaken who have held\nthat tropes necessarily involved the substitution of\nword for word. And I do not ignore the fact that as a rule the tropes employed to express our meaning\ninvolve ornament as well, though the converse is not\nthe case, since there are some which are intended\nsolely for the purpose of embellishment. Let us begin, then, with the commonest and by far\nthe most beautiful of tropes, namely, metaphor, the\nGreek term for our translatio. It is not merely so\nnatural a turn of speech that it is often employed unconsciously or by uneducated persons, but it is in itself\nso attractive and elegant that however distinguished\nthe language in which it is embedded it shines forth\nwith a light that is all its own. For if it be correctly\nand appropriately applied, it is quite impossible\nfor its effect to be commonplace, mean or unpleasing. It adds to the copiousness of language by the\ninterchange of words and by borrowing, and finally\nsucceeds in accomplishing the supremely difficult\ntask of providing a name for everything. A noun\nor a verb is transferred from the place to which it\nproperly belongs to another where there is either no\nliteral term or the transferred is better than the literal.\nWe do this either because it is necessary or to make\nour meaning clearer or, as I have already said, to produce a decorative effect. When it secures none of\nthese results, our metaphor will be out of place. As\nan example of a necessary metaphor I may quote the\nfollowing usages in vogue with peasants when they\ncall a vinebud gemma, a gem what other term is\nthere which they could use, or speak of the crops\nbeing thirsty or the fruit suffering. For the same\nreason we speak of a hard or rough man, there being\nno literal term for these temperaments. On the\nother hand, when we say that a man is kindled to\nanger or on fire with greed or that he has fallen into error, we do so to enhance our meaning. For none\nof these things can be more literally described in its\nown words than in those which we import from\nelsewhere. But it is a purely ornamental metaphor\nwhen we speak of brilliance of style, splendour of\nbirth, tempestuous public assemblies, thunderbolts of\neloquence, to which I may add the phrase employed\nby Cicero in his defence of Milo where he speaks\nof Clodius as the fountain, and in another place as\nthe fertile field and material of his client's glory. It\nis even possible to express facts of a somewhat\nunseemly character by a judicious use of metaphor,\nas in the following passage On the whole metaphor is a shorter form of simile,\nwhile there is this further difference, that in the\nlatter we compare some object to the thing which we\nwish to describe, whereas in the former this object is\nactually substituted for the thing. It is a comparison when I say that a man did something like a\nlion, it is a metaphor when I say of him, He is a lion.\nMetaphors fall into four classes. In the first we\nsubstitute one living thing for another, as in the\npassage where the poet, speaking of a charioteer,\nsays, or when Livy says that Scipio was continually\nbarked at by Cato. Secondly, inanimate things may\nbe substituted for inanimate, as in the Virgilian. or inanimate may be substituted for animate, as in or animate for inanimate, as in the following lines But, above all, effects of extraordinary sublimity are\nproduced when the theme is exalted by a bold and\nalmost hazardous metaphor and inanimate objects\nare given life and action, as in the phrase or in the passage of Cicero, already quoted, where\nhe cries, Sometimes the effect is doubled, as in Virgil's. For both and are metaphors. These four kinds of\nmetaphor are further subdivided into a number of\nspecies, such as transference from rational beings\nto rational and from irrational to irrational and the\nreverse, in which the method is the same, and\nfinally from the whole to its parts and from the\nparts to the whole. But I am not now teaching\nboys my readers are old enough to discover the\nspecies for themselves when once they have been\ngiven the genus. While a temperate and timely use of metaphor is a real adornment to style, on the other hand, its\nfrequent use serves merely to obscure our language\nand weary our audience, while if we introduce them\nin one continuous series, our language will become\nallegorical and enigmatic. There are also certain\nmetaphors which fail from meanness, such as that\nof which I spoke above or they may even be coarse. For it does not\nfollow that because Cicero was perfectly justified\nin talking of when\nhe desired to indicate the foulness of certain\nmen, we can approve the following passage from\nan ancient orator Indeed Cicero himself has demonstrated in the most admirable manner how important it is to avoid grossness in metaphor, such\nas is revealed by the following examples, which he\nquotes or He also points out that a metaphor\nmust not be too great for its subject or, as is more\nfrequently the case, too little, and that it must not\nbe inappropriate. Anyone who realises that these\nare faults, will be able to detect instances of them\nonly too frequently. But excess in the use of metaphor is also a fault, more especially if they are of the\nsame species. Metaphors may also be harsh, that is,\nfar-fetched, as in phrases like or The worst errors of all, however, originate in the\nfact that some authors regard it as permissible to\nuse even in prose any metaphors that are allowed to\npoets, in spite of the fact that tile latter aim solely\nat pleasing their readers and are compelled in many\ncases to employ metaphor by sheer metrical necessity. For my own part I should not regard a phrase\nlike as admissible in\npleading, although it has the authority of Homer,\nnor would I venture to say that winged creatures despite the fact that this\nmetaphor has been most effectively employed by\nVirgil to describe the flight of bees and of Daedalus.1 For metaphor should always either occupy\na place already vacant, or if it fills the room of something else, should be more impressive than that\nwhich it displaces. What I have said above applies perhaps with even\ngreater force to synecdoche. For while metaphor is\ndesigned to move the feelings, give special distinction to things and place them vividly before\nthe eye, synecdoche has the power to give variety to\nour language by making us realise many things\nfrom one, the whole from a part, the genus from a\nspecies, things which follow from things which have\npreceded; or, on the other hand, the whole procedure may be reversed. It may, however, be more\nfreely employed by poets than by orators. For\nwhile in prose it is perfectly correct to use macro,\nthe point, for the whole sword, and tectum, roof, for a\nwhole house, we may not employ puppis, stern, to\ndescribe a ship, nor abies, fir, to describe planks;\nand again, though ferrunm, the steel, may be used to\nindicate a sword, quadrupes cannot be used in the sense of horse. It is where numbers are concerned\nthat synecdoche can be most freely employed in\nprose. For example, Livy frequently says, when he means that the\nRomans were victorious; on the other hand, Cicero\nin a letter to Brutus says, when he is\nspeaking of himself alone. This form of trope is\nnot only a rhetorical ornament, but is frequently\nemployed in everyday speech. Some also apply the\nterm synecdoche when something is assumed which\nhas not actually been expressed, since one word is\nthen discovered from other words, as in the sentence, when such omission creates a blemish, it is called an\nellipse. For my own part, I prefer to regard this as\na figure, and shall therefore discuss it under that\nhead. Again, one thing may be suggested by\nanother, as in the line, from which we infer the approach of night. I am\nnot sure whether this is permissible to an orator\nexcept in arguments, when it serves as an indication\nof some fact. However, this has nothing to do with\nthe question of style. It is but a short step from synecdoche to metonymy,\nwhich consists in the substitution of one name for\nanother, and, as Cicero tells us, is called hypallage\nby the rhetoricians. These devices are employed to\nindicate an invention by substituting the name of the inventor, or a possession by substituting the\nname of the possessor. Virgil, for example, writes and Horace If, however, the process is reversed, the effect is\nharsh. But it is important to enquire to what\nextent tropes of this kind should be employed by\nthe orator. For though we often hear used for fire and to say vario Marte pugnatum est for is elegant and\nidiomatic, while Venus is a more decent expression\nthan coitus, it would be too bold for the severe style\ndemanded in the courts to speak of Liber and Ceres\nwhen we mean bread and wine. Again, while usage\npermits us to substitute that which contains for that\nwhich is contained, as in phrases such as or or the converse procedure would rarely be\nventured on by any save a poet take, for example,\nthe phrase It is, however, perhaps more permissible to describe\nwhat is possessed by reference to its possessor, as,\nfor example, to say of a man whose estate is being\nsquandered, Of this\nform there are innumerable species. For example,\nwe say and speak of when we mean\n; again, we say that supplies have when they have been that a and not a has been\ndetected, and that a man possesses a knowledge of not of The type which\nindicates cause by effect is common both in poets\nand orators. As examples from poetry I may quote and The following type of trope has also some kinship\nwith synecdoch. For when I speak of a man's instead of his I use the plural for\nthe singular, but my aim is not to enable one thing\nto be inferred from many for the sense is clear\nenough, but I merely vary the form of the word.\nAgain, when I call a a I diverge a little from the truth, because gilding\nforms only a part of the roof. But to follow out\nthese points is a task involving too much minute\ndetail even for a work whose aim is not the\ntraining of an orator. Antonomasia, which substitutes something else for\na proper name, is very common in poets it may be\ndone in two ways by the substitution of an epithet\nas equivalent to the name which it replaces, such as or by indicating the most\nstriking characteristics of an individual, as in the\nphrase or from acts clearly indicating the individual, as in\nthe phrase, This form of trope is rare in oratory, but is occasionally employed, For although an orator would\nnot say or he will speak of\ncertain definite persons as while I should have no hesitation in speaking of\nScipio as or of Cicero as Cicero himself, at any rate, availed himself of this\nlicence, as, for example, in the following case where neither name is given, though both\nare clearly understood. On the other hand, onomatopoea, that is to say, the\ncreation of a word, although regarded with the\nhighest approbation by the Greeks, is scarcely permissible to a Roman. It is true that many words\nwere created in this way by the original founders of\nthe language, who adapted them to suit the sensation\nwhich they expressed. For instance, mugitus, lowing,\nsibilus, a hiss, and murmur owe their origin to this\npractice. But to-day we consider that all has been\ndone that can be done in this line, and do not venture\non fresh creations, in spite of the fact that many\nof the words thus formed in antiquity are daily\nbecoming obsolete. Indeed, we scarcely permit ourselves to use new derivatives, so they are called,\nwhich are formed in various ways from words in\ncommon use, such as Sullaturit, or proscripturit, while laureati posies, for lauru coronati, are similar formations.      \n         These facts make catachresis of which abuse is a\ncorrect translation all the more necessary. By this\nterm is meant the practice of adapting the nearest\navailable term to describe something for which no\nactual term exists, as in the line or as in the expression found in tragedy, The following examples are of a similar character.\nFlasks are called acetabula, whatever they contain,\nand caskets pyxides, of whatever material they are\nmade, while parricide includes the murder of a\nmother or a brother. We must be careful to\ndistinguish between abuse and metaphor, since the\nformer is employed where there is no proper term\navailable, and the latter when there is another term\navailable. As for poets, they indulge in the abuse\nof words even in cases where proper terms do exist,\nand substitute words of somewhat similar meaning.\nBut this is rare in prose. Some, indeed, would give\nthe name of catachresis even to cases such as where\nwe call temerity valour or prodigality liberality.\nI, however, cannot agree with them; for in these instances word is not substituted for word, but thing\nfor thing, since no one regards prodigality and liberality as meaning the same, but one man calls certain\nactions liberal and another prodigal, although neither\nfor a moment doubts the difference between the two\nqualities. There is but one of the tropes involving change of\nmeaning which remains to be discussed, namely,\nmetalepsis or transumption, which provides a transition\nfrom one trope to another. It is if we except\ncomedy but rarely used in Latin, and is by no means\nto be commended, though it is not infrequently\nemployed by the Greeks, who, for example, call the centaur and substitute the epithet swift for in referring to sharp-pointed\nislands. But who would endure a Roman if he\ncalled Verres sus or changed the name of Aelius\nCatus to Aelius doctus It is the nature of metalepsis\nto form a kind of intermediate step between the\nterm transferred and the thing to which it is transferred, having no meaning in itself, but merely\nproviding a transition. It is a trope with which to\nclaim acquaintance, rather than one which we are\never likely to require to use. The commonest\nexample is the following cano is a synonym\nfor canto and canto for dico, therefore cano is a\nsynonym for dico, the intermediate step being provided by canto. We need not waste any more time\nover it. I can see no use in it except, as I have\nalready said, in comedy. The remaining tropes are employed solely to\nadorn and enhance our style without any reference\nto the meaning. For the epithet, of which the correct\ntranslation is appositum, though some call it sequens, is clearly an ornament. Poets employ it with special\nfrequency and freedom, since for them it is sufficient\nthat the epithet should suit the word to which it is\napplied consequently we shall not blame them\nwhen they speak of or But in oratory an epithet is redundant\nunless it has some point. Now it will only have\npoint when it adds something to the meaning, as for\ninstance in the following But its decorative effect is greatest\nwhen it is metaphorical, as in the phrases or The\nepithet is generally made into a trope by the addition\nof something to it, as when Virgil speaks of or But the nature\nof this form of embellishment is such that, while\nstyle is bare and inelegant without any epithets\nat all, it is overloaded when a large number are\nemployed. For then it becomes long-winded and\ncumbrous, in fact you might compare it to an army\nwith as many camp-followers as soldiers, an army, that\nis to say, which has doubled its numbers without\ndoubling its strength. None the less, not merely\nsingle epithets are employed, but we may find a\nnumber of them together, as in the following passage\nfrom Virgil Be this as it may, two epithets directly attached\nto one noun are unbecoming even in verse. There\nare some writers who refuse to regard an epithet as a\ntrope, on the ground that it involves no change. It is not always a trope, but if separated from the word to\nwhich it belongs, it has a significance of its own and\nforms an antonomasia. For if you say, it will\nbe an antonomasia, whereas, if you add the word the phrase will be an epithet. An epithet\ntherefore cannot stand by itself. Allegory, which is translated in Latin by inversio,\neither presents one thing in words and another in\nmeaning, or else something absolutely opposed to the\nmeaning of the words. The first type is generally produced by a series of metaphors. Take as an example and the rest of the ode, in which Horace represents\nthe state under the semblance of a ship, the civil\nwars as tempests, and peace and good-will as the\nhaven. Such, again, is the claim of Lucretius and such again the passage where Virgil says, On the other hand, in the Bucolics he introduces\nan allegory without any metaphor For in this passage, with the exception of the\nproper name, the words bear no more than their\nliteral meaning. But the name does not simply denote the shepherd Menalcas, but is a pseudonym for\nVirgil himself. Oratory makes frequent use of such\nallegory, but generally with this modification, that\nthere is an admixture of plain speaking. We get\nallegory pure and unadulterated in the following\npassage of Cicero The following is an example\nof the commonest type, namely, the mixed allegory Had he not added\nthe words we should have had pure allegory\ntheir addition, however, converted it into a mixed\nallegory. In this type of allegory the ornamental\nelement is provided by the metaphorical words and\nthe meaning is indicated by those which are used\nliterally. But far the most ornamental effect is produced by the artistic admixture of simile, metaphor\nand allegory, as in the following example For it is all-important to follow\nthe principle illustrated by this passage and never to mix your metaphors. But there are many who, after\nbeginning with a tempest, will end with a fire or a\nfalling house, with the result that they produce a\nhideously incongruous effect. For the rest, allegory\nis often used by men of little ability and in the\nconversation of everyday life. For those hackneyed\nphrases of forensic pleading, or are all of\nthem allegorical, although they do not strike the\nattention for it is novelty and change that please\nin oratory, and what is unexpected always gives special\ndelight. Consequently we have thrown all restraint\nto the wind in such matters, and have destroyed the\ncharm of language by the extravagant efforts which\nwe have made to attain it. Illustrative examples also\ninvolve allegory if not preceded by an explanation;\nfor there are numbers of sayings available for use like\nthe which is such a\nfavourite with the Greeks. When, however, an allegory\nis too obscure, we call it a riddle such riddles are,\nin my opinion, to be regarded as blemishes, in view of\nthe fact that lucidity is a virtue; nevertheless they\nare used by poets, as, for example, by Virgil in the\nfollowing lines Even orators sometimes use them, as when Caelius\nspeaks of the For although we\nknow the answers, and although they were better\nknown at the time when the words were uttered, they are riddles for all that; and other riddles are,\nafter all, intelligible if you can get someone to explain\nthem. On the other hand, that class of allegory in which\nthe meaning is contrary to that suggested by the\nwords, involve an element of irony, or, as our\nrhetoricians call it, illusio. This is made evident to\nthe understanding either by the delivery, the character of the speaker or the nature of the subject.\nFor if any one of these three is out of keeping with\nthe words, it at once becomes clear that the intention of the speaker is other than what he actually\nsays In the majority of tropes it is, however,\nimportant to bear in mind not merely what is said,\nbut about whom it is said, since what is said may\nin another context be literally true. It is permissible to censure with counterfeited praise and\npraise under a pretence of blame. The following will\nserve as an example of the first. As an example of the reverse process we may take\nthe following Sometimes, again,\nwe may speak in mockery when we say the opposite\nof what we desire to be understood, as in Cicero's\ndenunciation of Clodius Further, we may employ allegory, and\ndisguise bitter taunts in gentle words I y way of wit,\nor we may indicate our meaning by saying exactly\nthe contrary or. . . If the Greek names for these methods are unfamiliar to any of my readers, I would\nremind him that they are and sarcasm, urbane wit, contradiction and proverbs. There are, however, some\nwriters who deny that these are species of allegory,\nand assert that they are actually tropes in themselves\nfor they argue shrewdly that allegory involves an\nelement of obscurity, whereas in all these cases our\nmeaning is perfectly obvious. To this may be added\nthe fact that when a genus is divided into species, it\nceases to have any peculiar properties of its own for\nexample, we may divide tree into its species, pine,\nolive, cypress, etc., leaving it no properties of its own,\nwhereas allegory always has some property peculiar\nto itself. The only explanation of this fact is that\nit is itself a species. But this, of course, is a matter\nof indifference to those that use it. To these the\nGreeks add or mockery under the\nthinnest of disguises. When we use a number of words to describe something for which one, or at any rate only a few words\nof description would suffice, it is called periphrasis,\nthat is, a circuitous mode of speech. It is sometimes\nnecessary, being of special service when it conceals\nsomething which would be indecent, if expressed in\nso many words compare the phrase from Sallust. But at times it\nis employed solely for decorative effect, a practice\nmost frequent among the poets Still it is far from uncommon even in oratory, though in such cases it is always used with greater restraint.\nFor whatever might have been expressed with greater\nbrevity, but is expanded for purposes of ornament, is\na periphrasis, to which we give the name circumlocution,\nthough it is a term scarcely suitable to describe one\nof the virtues of oratory. But it is only called periphrasis so long as it produces a decorative effect\nwhen it passes into excess, it is known as perissology\nfor whatever is not a help, is a positive hindrance. Again, hyperbaton, that is, the transposition of a\nword, is often demanded by the structure of the\nsentence and the claims of elegance, and is consequently counted among the ornaments of style.\nFor our language would often be harsh, rough, limp\nor disjointed, if the words were always arranged in\ntheir natural order and attached each to each just\nas they occur, despite the fact that there is no real\nbond of union. Consequently some words require\nto be postponed, others to be anticipated, each\nbeing set in its appropriate place. For we are like\nthose who build a wall of unhewn stone we cannot\nhew or polish our words in order to make them fit\nmore compactly, and so we must take them as they\nare and choose suitable positions for them. Further,\nit is impossible to make our prose rhythmical except\nby artistic alterations in the order of words, and\nthe reason why those four words in which Plato\nin the noblest of his works states that he had gone\ndown to the Piraeus were found written in a number\nof different orders upon his wax tablets, was simply\nthat he desired to make the rhythm as perfect as\npossible. When, however, the transposition is confined to two words only, it is called anastrophe, that\nis, a reversal of order. This occurs in everyday speech in mecum and secure, while in orators and\nhistorians we meet with it in the phrase quibus de\nrebus. It is the transposition of a word to some\ndistance from its original place, in order to secure\nan ornamental effect, that is strictly called hyperbaton the following passage will provide an example\nanimadverti, indices, omnem accusatoris orationenm in duas\ndivisam esse partes. \nIn this case the strictly correct order would be in duas\npartes divisam esse, but this would have been harsh\nand ugly. The poets even go so far as to secure\nthis effect by the division of words, as in the line a licence wholly inadmissible in oratory. Still there\nis good reason for calling such a transposition a trope,\nsince the meaning is not complete until the two words\nhave been put together. On the other hand, when\nthe transposition makes no alteration in the sense, and\nmerely produces a variation in the structure, it is rather\nto be called a verbal figure, as indeed many authorities\nhave held. Of the faults resulting from long or confused hyperbata have spoken in the appropriate place. I have kept hyperbole to the last, on the ground of\nits boldness. It means an elegant straining of the\ntruth, and may be employed indifferently for exaggeration or attenuation. It can be used in various\nways. We may say more than the actual facts, as\nwhen Cicero says, He vomited and filled his lap\nand the whole tribunal with fragments of food, or\nwhen Virgil speaks of Again, we may exalt our theme by the use of simile,\nas in the phrase Or we may produce the same result by introducing\na comparison, as in the phrase or by the use of indications, as in the lines Or we may employ a metaphor, as the verb to fly is\nemployed in the passage just quoted. Sometimes,\nagain, one hyperbole may be heightened by the\naddition of another, as when Cicero in denouncing\nAntony says I think, too, that I am right in saying that\nI noted a brilliant example of the same kind in the\nHymns of Pindar, the prince of lyric poets. For\nwhen he describes the onslaught made by Hercules\nupon the Meropes, the legendary inhabitants of the\nisland of Cos, he speaks of the hero as like not to\nfire, winds or sea, but to the thunderbolt, making\nthe latter the only true equivalent of his speed and\npower, the former being treated as quite inadequate.\nCicero has imitated his method in the following passage from the Verrines The methods\nof hyperbole by attenuation are the same in number.\nCompare the Virgilian or the lines from a humorous work of Cicero's, But even here a certain proportion must be observed.\nFor although every hyperbole involves the incredible,\nit must not go too far in this direction, which\nprovides the easiest road to extravagant affectation.\nI shrink from recording the faults to which the lack\nof this sense of proportion has given rise, more\nespecially as they are so well known and obvious.\nIt is enough to say that hyperbole lies, though\nwithout any intention to deceive. We must therefore be all the more careful to consider how far we\nmay go in exaggerating facts which our audience\nmay refuse to believe. Again, hyperbole will often\ncause a laugh. If that was what the orator desired, we may give him credit for wit; otherwise we can\nonly call him a fool. Hyperbole is employed even\nby peasants and uneducated persons, for the good\nreason that everybody has an innate passion for\nexaggeration or attenuation of actual facts, and no\none is ever contented with the simple truth. But\nsuch disregard of truth is pardonable, for it does not\ninvolve the definite assertion of the thing that is not.\nHyperbole is, moreover, a virtue, when the subject\non which we have to speak is abnormal. For we are\nallowed to amplify, when the magnitude of the facts\npasses all words, and in such circumstances our\nlanguage will be more effective if it goes beyond\nthe truth than if it falls short of it. However, I\nhave said enough on this topic, since I have already\ndealt with it in my work on the causes of the decline\nof oratory. In my last book I spoke of tropes. I now come\ntofigures, called in Greek, a topic which is\nnaturally and closely connected with the preceding.\nFor many authors have considered figures identical\nwith tropes, because whether it be that the latter\nderive their name from having a certain form or from\nthe fact that they effect alterations in language a\nview which has also led to their being styled motions,\nit must be admitted that both these features are\nfound in figures as well. Their employment is also\nthe same. For they add force and charm to our\nmatter. There are some again who call tropes figures,\nArtorius Proculus among them. Further the resemblance between the two is so close that it is not easy\nto distinguish between them. For although certain\nkinds differ, while retaining a general resemblance\nsince both involve a departure from the simple and\nstraightforward method of expression coupled with\na certain rhetorical excellence, on the other hand\nsome are distinguished by the narrowest possible\ndividing line for example, while irony belongs to\nfigures of thought just as much as to tropes,  periphrasis,\nhyperbaton and onomatopoea have been ranked by\ndistinguished authors as figures of speech rather than\ntropes. It is therefore all the more necessary to point out\nthe distinction between the two. The name of trope is applied to the transference of expressions from\ntheir natural and principal signification to another,\nwith a view to the embellishment of style or, as the\nmajority of grammarians define it, the transference\nof words and phrases from the place which is strictly\ntheirs to another to which they do not properly\nbelong. A figure, on the other hand, as is clear from\nthe name itself, is the term employed when we give\nour language a conformation other than the obvious\nand ordinary. Therefore the substitution of one\nword for another is placed among tropes, as for\nexample in the case of metaphor, metonymy, antonomasia, metalepsis, synecdoch, catachresis, allegory and,\nas a rule, hyperbole, which may, of course, be concerned either with words or things. Onomatopoea is\nthe creation of a word and therefore involves substitution for the words which we should use but\nfor such creation. Again although periphrasis often\nincludes the actual word whose place it supplies, it\nstill uses a number of words in place of one. The\nepithet as a rule involves an element of antonomasia\nand consequently becomes a trope on account of this\naffinity. Hyperbaton is a change of order and for\nthis reason many exclude it from tropes. None the\nless it transfers a word or part of a word from its\nown place to another. None of these can be called\nfigures. For a figure does not necessarily involve\nany alteration either of the order or the strict sense\nof words. As regards irony, I shall show elsewhere\nhow in some of its forms it is a trope, in others a\nfigure. For I admit that the name is common to\nboth and am aware of the complicated and minute\ndiscussions to which it has given rise. They, however, have no bearing on my present task. For it makes no difference by which name either is called, so\nlong as its stylistic value is apparent, since the meaning of things is not altered by a change of name.\nFor just as men remain the same, even though they\nadopt a new name, so these artifices will produce\nexactly the same effect, whether they are styled\ntropes or figures, since their values lie not in their\nnames, but in their effect. Similarly it makes no\ndifference whether we call a basis conjectural or\nnegative, or concerned with fact or substance, provided always that we know that the subject of\nenquiry is the same. It is best therefore in dealing\nwith these topics to adopt the generally accepted\nterms and to understand the actual thing, by whatever name it is called. But we must note the fact\nthat trope and figure are often combined in the\nexpression of the same thought, since figures are\nintroduced just as much by the metaphorical as by\nthe literal use of words. There is, however, a considerable difference of\nopinion among authors as to the meaning of the\nname, the number of genera and the nature and\nnumber of the species into which figures may be\ndivided. The first point for consideration is, therefore, what is meant by a figure. For the term is\nused in two senses. In the first it is applied to any\nform in which thought is expressed, just as it is to\nbodies which, whatever their composition, must have\nsome shape. In the second and special sense, in\nwhich it is called a schema, it means a rational change\nin meaning or language from the ordinary and simple\nform, that is to say, a change analogous to that\ninvolved by sitting, lying down on something or\nlooking back. Consequently when a student tends to continuous or at any rate excessive use of the\nsame cases, tenses, rhythms or even feet, we are in\nthe habit of instructing him to vary his figures with\na view to the avoidance of monotony. In so doing\nwe speak as if every kind of language possessed a\nfigure for example cursitare and lectitare are said\nto have the same figure, that is to say, they are\nidentical in formation. Therefore in the first and\ncommon sense of the word everything is expressed\nby figures. If we are content with this view, there\nis good reason for the opinion expressed by Apollodorus if we may trust the statement of Caecilius on\nthis point to the effect that he found the rules laid\ndown in this connexion quite incomprehensible. If,\non the other hand, the name is to be applied to\ncertain attitudes, or I might say gestures of language,\nwe must interpret schema in the sense of that which\nis poetically or rhetorically altered from the simple\nand obvious method of expression. It will then be\ntrue to distinguish between the style which is devoid\nof figures or  and that which is adorned\nwith figures or . But Zoilus narrowed\ndown the definition, since he restricted the term\nschema to cases when the speaker pretends to say\nsomething other than that which he actually does\nsay. 1 know that this view meets with common\nacceptance it is, in fact, for this reason that we speak\nof figured controversial themes, of which I shall\nshortly speak. We shall then take a figure to mean\na form of expression to which a new aspect is given\nby art. Some writers have held that there is only one\nkind of figure, although they differ as regards the\nreasons which lead them to adopt this view. For some of them, on the ground that a change of words\ncauses a corresponding change in the sense, assert\nthat all figures are concerned with words, while others\nhold that figures are concerned solely with the sense,\non the ground that words are adapted to things.\nBoth these views are obviously quibbling. For the\nsame things are often put in different ways and\nthe sense remains unaltered though the words are\nchanged, while a figure of thought may include several\nfigures of speech. For the former lies in the conception, the latter in the expression of our thought.\nThe two are frequently combined, however, as in\nthe following passage  for\nthe device by which he turns from the judges to\nDolabella is a figure of thought, while iam iam  \nand liberum  are figures of speech. It is, however, to the best of my knowledge,\ngenerally agreed by the majority of authors that\nthere are two classes of figure, namely figures of\nthought, that is of the mind, feeling or conceptions,\nsince all these terms are used, and figures of speech,\nthat is of words, diction, expression, language or\nstyle the name by which they are known varies,\nbut mere terminology is a matter of indifference.\nCornelius Celsus, however, to figures of thought and\nspeech would add those produced by ; but\nhe has merely been led astray by an excessive passion\nfor novelty. For who can suppose that so learned\na man was ignorant of the fact that and both come under the heading of\nthought We may therefore conclude that, like\nlanguage itself, figures are necessarily concerned with\nthought and with words. As, however, in the natural course of things we\nconceive ideas before we express them, I must take\nfigures of thought first. Their utility is at once great\nand manifold, and is revealed with the utmost clearness in every product of oratory. For although it\nmay seem that proof is infinitesimally affected by\nthe figures employed, none the less those same figures\nlend credibility to our arguments and steal their\nway secretly into the minds of the judges. For just\nas in sword-play it is easy to see, parry, and ward off'\ndirect blows and simple and straightforward thrusts,\nwhile side-strokes and feints are less easy to observe\nand the task of the skilful swordsman is to give the\nimpression that his design is quite other than it\nactually is, even so the oratory in which there is\nno guile fights by sheer weight and impetus alone;\non the other hand, the fighter who feints and varies\nhis assault is able to attack flank or back as he will,\nto lure his opponent's weapons from their guard and\nto outwit him by a slight inclination of the body.\nFurther, there is no more effective method of exciting\nthe emotions than an apt use of figures. For if the\nexpression of brow, eyes and hands has a powerful\neffect in stirring the passions, how much more\neffective must be the aspect of our style itself when\ncomposed to produce the result at which we aim\nBut, above all, figures serve to commend what we\nsay to those that hear us, whether we seek to win\napproval for our character as pleaders, or to win\nfavour for the cause which we plead, to relieve\nmonotony by variation of our language, or to indicate\nour meaning in the safest or most seemly way. But before I proceed to demonstrate what figures\nbest suit the different circumstances, I must point out that their number is far from being as\ngreat as some authorities make out. For I am not\nin the least disturbed by the various names which\nthe Greeks more especially are so fond of inventing.\nFirst of all, then, I must repudiate the views of those\nwho hold that there are as many types of figure\nas there are kinds of emotion, on the ground, not\nthat emotions are not qualities of the mind, but that\na figure, in its strict, not its general sense, is not\nsimply the expression of anything you choose to\nselect. Consequently the expression in words of\nanger, grief, pity, fear, confidence or contempt is\nnot a figure, any more than persuasion, threats,\nentreaty or excuse. But superficial observers are\ndeceived by the fact that they find figures in all\npassages dealing with such themes, and select\nexamples of them from speeches; whereas in reality\nthere is no department of oratory which does not\nadmit such figures. But it is one thing to admit\nigt;figure and another to be a figure; I am not going\nto be frightened out of repeating the term with some\nfrequency in my attempt to make the facts clear.\nMy opponents will, I know, direct my attention to\nspecial figures employed in expressing anger, in\nentreating for mercy, or appealing to pity, but it\ndoes not follow that expressions of anger, appeals\nto pity or entreaties for mercy are in themselves\nfigures. Cicero, it is true, includes all ornaments of\noratory under this head, and in so doing adopts, as\nit seems to me, a middle course. For he does not\nhold that all forms of expression are to be regarded\nas figures, nor, on the other hand, would he restrict\nthe term merely to those expressions whose form\nvaries from ordinary use. But he regards as figurative all those expressions which are especially\nstriking and most effective in stirring the emotions\nof the audience. He sets forth this view in two of\nhis works, and that my readers may have the\nopportunity of realising the judgment of so high\nan authority, I subjoin what he says verbatim. In the third book of the de Oratore we find the\nfollowing words Most of these statements are repeated by Cicero\nin the Orator, but not all, while his language is\nsomewhat more precise, since after dealing with\nfigures of speech and of thought he adds a third\nsection, concerned, as he himself says, with the other\nexcellences of style. The student who desires to give a wider consideration to figures of thought and speech will,\ntherefore, have a guide to follow, and 1 would not\nventure to assert that he could have a better. But\nI would ask him to read these passages of Cicero with\nreference to my own views on this subject. For I\nintend to speak only of those figures of thought\nwhich depart from the direct method of statement,\nand I note that a similar procedure has been adopted\nby a number of learned scholars. On the other hand,\nall those embellishments which differ in character\nfrom these are none the less virtues whose importance is such that without them all oratory will be\nlittle less than unintelligible. For how can the judge\nbe adequately instructed unless lucidity characterise\nour performance of the following tasks explanation,\nproposition, promise of proofs, definition, distinction,\nexposition of our own opinion, logical conclusion, defence by anticipation, introduction of comparisons or\nprecedents, disposition and distribution, interruption,\nrepression of those who interrupt us, antithesis, exculpation and personal attack Again, what would\neloquence do if deprived of the artifices of amplification and its opposite of which the first requires the\ngift of signifying more than we say, that is emphasis,\ntogether with exaggeration and overstatement of the\ntruth, while the latter requires the power to diminish\nand palliate. What scope is there for the stronger\nemotions if the orator is not allowed to give free rein to his speech, to flame out in anger, to reproach, to\nwish or execrate Or for the milder emotions without the assistance of commendation, conciliation and\nhumour What pleasure can an orator hope to produce, or what impression even of the most moderate\nlearning, unless he knows how to fix one point in the\nminds of the audience by repetition, and another by\ndwelling on it, how to digress from and return to his\ntheme, to divert the blame from himself and transfer\nit to another, or to decide what points to omit and\nwhat to ignore as negligible It is qualities such as\nthese that give life and vigour to oratory; without\nthem it lies torpid like a body lacking the breath to\nstir its limbs. But more than the mere possession of\nthese qualities is required; they must be deployed,\neach in their proper place and with such variety that\nevery sound may bewitch the hearer with all the\ncharm of music. But these qualities are as a rule\nopen and direct, manifesting themselves without\ndisguise. They do, however, as I have said, admit\nof figures, as the instances to which I shall proceed\nwill show. What is more common than to ask or enquire\nFor both terms are used indifferently, although the\none seems to imply a desire for knowledge, and the\nother a desire to prove something. But whichever\nterm we use, the thing which they represent admits\na variety of figures. We will begin with those which\nserve to increase the force and cogency of proof to\nwhich I assign the first place. A simple question\nmay be illustrated by the line On the other hand, a question involves a figure, whenever it is employed not to get information, but\nto emphasise our point, as in the following examples and and with the\nwhole passage that follows. How much greater is\nthe fire of his words as they stand than if he had\nsaid, and We may also\nask what cannot be denied, as Or we may put a question to which it is difficult to\nreply, as in the common forms, Or we may ask a question\nwith a view to throw odium on the person to whom\nit is addressed, as in the words placed by Seneca in\nthe mouth of Medea Or our aim may be to excite pity, as is the case with\nthe question asked by Sinon in Virgil Or to embarrass our opponent and to deprive him of\nthe power to feign ignorance of our meaning, as\nAsinius does in the following sentence In fact questions admit of infinite variety. They\nmay serve our indignation, as in the line Or they may still express wonder, as in Again, at times they may express a sharp command,\nas in Or we may ask ourselves, as in the phrase of Terence, A figure is also involved\nin a reply, when one question is asked and another\nis answered, because it suits the respondent's purpose\nbetter to do so, or because it aggravates the charge\nbrought against the accused. For example, a witness\nfor the prosecution was asked whether he had been\ncudgelled by the plaintiff, and replied, Or the purpose\nmay be to elude a charge, a very common form of\nreply. The advocate says, The accused replies, The advocate asks, The accused replies, Again, the\nanswer may be of such a kind as to make defence\nprecede confession. For example, in the Eclogues\nof Virgil, when one shepherd asks the other replies Akin to this kind of answer is the dissimulatory reply, which is employed solely with the purpose\nof raising a laugh, and has therefore been treated\nin its appropriate place. If it were meant seriously,\nit would be tantamount to a confession. Further,\nthere is the practice of putting the question and\nanswering it oneself, which may have quite a pleasing\neffect. Take as an example the following passage\nfrom the pro Ligario, where Cicero says, A different\nform of fictitious question is to be found in the pro\nCaelio. with the whole passage that follows.\nThen comes his reply, A different\nmethod is to ask a question and not to wait for a\nreply, but to subjoin the reply at once yourself.\nFor example, This is a figure which some call\nsuggestion. Again, a question may involve comparison,\nas, for instance, There are\nother forms of question as well, some concise, some\ndeveloped at greater length, some dealing with one\nthing only, others with several.\nAnticipation, or, as the Greeks call it, whereby we forestall objections, is of extraordinary\nvalue in pleading; it is frequently employed in all\nparts of a speech, but is especially useful in the\nexordium. However, it forms a genus in itself, and has several different species. One of these is the\ndefence by anticipation, such as Cicero employs\nagainst Quintus Caecilius, where he points out that\nthough previously he himself has always appeared\nfor the defence, he is now undertaking a prosecution.\nAnother is a form of confession, such as he introduces\nin his defence of Rabirius Postumus, where he\nadmits that he himself regards his client as worthy\nof censure for lending money to the king. Another\ntakes the form of prediction, as in the phrase, Again, there is a form of self-correction,\nsuch as, And, most frequent of all, there\nis preparation, whereby we state fully why we are\ngoing to do something or have done it. Anticipation\nmay also be employed to establish the meaning or\npropriety of words, as in the following case, while the same effect may be produced\nby qualification, as in the following sentence, Again, hesitation may lend an impression of truth\nto our statements, when, for example, we pretend\nto be at a loss, where to begin or end, or to decide\nwhat especially requires to be said or not to be said\nat all. All speeches are full of such instances, but\nfor the present one will be enough. This device may also be employed\nto cover the past; for we may equally pretend that\nwe had felt hesitation on the subject.\nThis figure is akin to that known as communication, when we actually take our opponents into consultation, as Domitius Afer does in his defence of Cloatilla. Or we may admit the\njudges to our deliberations, a device which is frequently called into play. We may say, or, or, Cato, for example, says, And in another passage, Sometimes, however, in such forms\nof communication we may add something unexpected,\na device which is in itself a figure, as Cicero does in\nthe Verrines Then, after keeping the minds of the judges in\nsuspense for a considerable time, he adds something\nmuch worse. This figure is termed suspension by\nCelsus. It has two forms. For we may adopt\nexactly the opposite procedure to that just mentioned,\nand after raising expectation of a sequel of the most\nserious nature, we may drop to something which is\nof a trivial character, and may even imply no offence\nat all. But since this does not necessarily involve\nany form of communication, some have given it the\nname of paradox or surprise. I do not agree with\nthose who extend the name of figure to a statement\nthat something has happened unexpectedly to the speaker himself, like the following passage from\nPollio The figure\nknown as concession springs from practically the same\nsource as communication; it occurs when we leave\nsome things to the judgment of the jury, or even\nin some cases of our opponents, as when Calvus\nsays to Vatinius, The figures best adapted for intensifying emotion\nconsist chiefly in simulation. For we may feign\nthat we are angry, glad, afraid, filled with wonder,\ngrief or indignation, or that we wish something, and\nso on. Hence we get passages like the following or, or, or, or, or, To this some give the name of exclamation, and\ninclude it among figures of speech. When, however,\nsuch exclamations are genuine, they do not come\nunder the head of our present topic it is only those\nwhich are simulated and artfully designed which can\nwith any certainty be regarded as figures. The same\nis true of free speech, which Corificius calls licence,\nand the Greeks For what has less of the\nfigure about it than true freedom On the other\nhand, freedom of speech may frequently be made a cloak for flattery. For when Cicero in his defence\nfor Ligarius says, he has in his mind\nsomething more than a desire to serve the interests\nof Ligarius, for there is no better way of praising\nthe clemency of the victor. On the other hand, in\nthe sentence, he succeeds with admirable art in representing the cause of both parties as being good, and\nin so doing mollifies him whose cause was really\nbad.\nA bolder form of figure, which in Cicero's opinion demands greater effort, is impersonation, or This is a device which lends wonderful variety and\nanimation to oratory. By this means we display the\ninner thoughts of our adversaries as though they were\ntalking with themselves but we shall only carry conviction if we represent them as uttering what they\nmay reasonably be supposed to have had in their\nminds; or without sacrifice of credibility we may\nintroduce conversations between ourselves and others,\nor of others among themselves, and put words of\nadvice, reproach, complaint, praise or pity into the\nmouths of appropriate persons. Nay, we are even\nallowed in this form of speech to bring down the\ngods from heaven and raise the dead, while cities\nalso and peoples may find a voice. There are some\nauthorities who restrict the term imepersonation to\ncases where both persons and words are fictitious, and\nprefer to call imaginary conversations between men\nby the Greek name of dialogue, which some translate by the Latin semnocinatio. For my own part, I have\nincluded both under the same generally accepted\nterm, since we cannot imagine a speech without we\nalso imagine a person to utter it. But when we lend\na voice to things to which nature has denied it, we\nmay soften down the figure in the way illustrated\nby the following passage A bolder\nfigure of the same kind may be illustrated by the\nfollowing It is also convenient at times to pretend that we have before our\neyes the images of things, persons or utterances, or\nto marvel that the same is not the case with our\nadversaries or the judges; it is with this design that\nwe use phrases such as or But such devices make a great\ndemand on our powers of eloquence. For with things\nwhich are false and incredible by nature there are but\ntwo alternatives either they will move our hearers\nwith exceptional force because they are beyond the\ntruth, or they will be regarded as empty nothings\nbecause they are not the truth. But we may introduce not only imaginary sayings, but imaginary\nwritings as well, as is done by Asinius in his defence\nof Liburnia This is in itself a figure,\nand is doubly so whenever, as in the present case, it imitates a document produced by the opposing\nparty. For a will had been read out by the prosecution, in the following form In this case the figure borders on\nparody, a name drawn from songs sung in imitation\nof others, but employed by an abuse of language to\ndesignate imitation in verse or prose. Again, we\noften personify the abstract, as Virgil does with\nFame, or as Xenophon records that Prodicus did\nwith Virtue and Pleasure, or as Ennius does when,\nin one of his satires, he represents Life and Death\ncontending with one another. We may also introduce some imaginary person without identifying\nhim, as we do in the phrases, or, Or\nspeech may be inserted without any mention of the\nspeaker, as in the line This involves a mixture of figures, since to impersonalion we add the figure known as ellipse, which\nin this case consists in the omission of any indication\nas to who is speaking. At times impersonation takes\nthe form of narrative. Thus we find indirect\nspeeches in the historians, as at the opening of\nLivy's first book Apostrophe also, which consists in the diversion of\nour address from the judge, is wonderfully stirring,\nwhether we attack our adversary as in the passage, or turn to make some invocation such as, or to entreaty that will bring odium on\nour opponents, as in the cry, But the term apostrophe is also\napplied to utterances that divert the attention of\nthe hearer from the question before them, as in the\nfollowing passage There are a number of different figures by which\nthis effect may be produced. We may, for instance,\npretend that we expected something different or\nfeared some greater disaster, or that the judges in\ntheir ignorance of the facts may regard some point\nas of more importance than it really is an example\nof this latter device is to be found in the exordium\nto Cicero's defence of Caelius. With regard to the figure which Cicero calls ocular\ndenonstration, this comes into play when we do not\nrestrict ourselves to mentioning that something was\ndone, but proceed to show how it was done, and do\nso not merely on broad general lines, but in full\ndetail. In the last book I classified this figure\nunder the head of vivid illustration, while Celsus\nactually terms it by this name. Others give the\nname of to any representation of facts\nwhich is made in such vivid language that they\nappeal to the eye rather than the ear. The following will show what I mean Nor is it only past or present actions\nwhich we may imagine we may equally well present\na picture of what is likely to happen or might have\nhappened. This is done with extraordinary skill by\nCicero in his defence of Milo, where he shows\nwhat Clodius would have done, had he succeeded\nin securing the praetorship. But this transference\nof time, which is technically called was\nmore modestly used in vivid description by the old\norators. For they would preface it by words such\nas  take, for example,\nthe words of Cicero Modern authors, however, more especially\nthe declaimers, are bolder, indeed they show the\nutmost animation in giving rein to their imagination;\nwitness the following passages from Seneca's treatment of the controversial theme in which a father,\nguided by one of his sons, finds another son in the\nact of adultery with his stepmother and kills both\nculprits. And a little\nlater, This figure is too dramatic\nfor the story seems to be acted, not narrated. Some\ninclude the clear and vivid description of places\nunder the same heading, while others call it\ntopography. I have found some who speak of irony as dissimulation, but, in view of the fact that this latter name does not cover the whole range of this figure, I shall\nfollow my general rule and rest content with the\nGreek term. Irony involving a figure does not differ\nfrom the irony which is a trope, as far as its genus is\nconcerned, since in both cases we understand something which is the opposite of what is actually said;\non the other hand, a careful consideration of the\nspecies of irony will soon reveal the fact that they\ndiffer. In the first place, the trope is franker in its\nmeaning, and, despite the fact that it implies something other than it says, makes no pretence about it.\nFor the context as a rule is perfectly clear, as, for\nexample, in the following passage from the Catilinarian orations. In this case the irony lies in two words,\nand is therefore a specially concise form of trope.\nBut in the figurative form of irony the speaker disguises his entire meaning, the disguise being apparent\nrather than confessed. For in the trope the conflict\nis purely verbal, while in the figure the meaning, and\nsometimes the whole aspect of our case, conflicts with\nthe language and the tone of voice adopted; nay, a\nman's whole life may be coloured with irony, as was\nthe case with Socrates, who was called an ironist\nbecause he assumed the role of an ignorant man lost\nin wonder at the wisdom of others. Thus, as continued metaphor develops into allegory, so a sustained\nseries of tropes develops into this figure. There are,\nhowever, certain kinds of this figure which have no\nconnexion with tropes. In the first place, there is the\nfigure which derives its name from negation and is\ncalled by some Here is an example\n; or again, or ; or ; or Such kinds of\nirony may even be sustained at times through whole\nsections of our argument, as, for instance, where\nCicero says, It is also irony\nwhen we assume the tone of command or concession,\nas in Virgil's or when we concede to our opponents qualities which\nwe are unwilling that they should seem to possess.\nThis is specially effective when we possess these\nqualities and they do not, as in the following\npassage, A like result is produced by reversing this method\nwhen we pretend to own to faults which are not ours\nor which even recoil upon the heads of our opponents, as for example, Further, this device of saying the opposite of what we desire to imply is not merely restricted to persons, but may be extended to things, witness the\nwhole of the exordium of the pro Ligario and disparaging phrases such as or Another example is provided by the following passage from the pro Oppio, Akin to irony\nalso are the following figures, which have a strong\nfamily resemblance confession of a kind that can do\nour case no harm, such as the following ; secondly, concession, when we pretend to admit something actually\nunfavourable to ourselves by way of showing our\nconfidence in our cause, as in the following passage\n; or again, in the pro\nCluentio, where Cicero is speaking of the prejudice\naroused against his client, ;\nthirdly, agreement, as when Cicero, in the same\nspeech, agrees that the jury was bribed. This last\nform offigure becomes more striking when we agree\nto something which is really likely to tell in our\nfavour; but such an opportunity can only occur\nthrough weakness on the part of our opponent\nSometimes we may even praise some action of our\nopponent, as Cicero does in his prosecution of Verres\nwhen dealing with the charge in connexion with Apollonius of Drepanum At times we may exaggerate charges against\nourselves which we can easily refute or deny; this\ndevice is too common to require any illustration. At\nother times we may by this same method make the\ncharges brought against us seem incredible just\nbecause of their gravity thus Cicero in his defence\nof Roscius, by the sheer force of his eloquence,\nexaggerates the horror of parricide, despite the fact\nthat it requires no demonstration. Aposiopesis, which Cicero calls reticentia, Celsus\nobticentia, and some interruptio, is used to indicate\npassion or anger, as in the line Or it may serve to give an impression of anxiety or\nscruple, as in the following There is a similar instance\nin the exordium of Demosthenes' speech in defence\nof Ctesiphon. Again it may be employed as a means\nof transition, as, for example, This last instance also\ninvolves digression, if indeed digression is to be\ncounted among figures, since some authorities regard\nit as forming one of the parts of a speech. For at this point the orator diverges to sing the praises of\nGnaeus Pompeius, which he might have done without any recourse to aposiopesis. For as Cicero says,\nthe shorter form of digression may be effected in a\nnumber of different ways. The following passages\nwill, however, suffice as examples the\nsecond is from the pro Milone There is also another kind of figure,\nwhich is not aposiopesis, since that involves leaving\na sentence unfinished, but consists in bringing our\nwords to a close before the natural point for their\nconclusion. The following is an example ; or The imitation of other persons' characteristics,\nwhich is styled or, as some prefer may be counted among the devices which serve to\nexcite the gentler emotions. For it consists mainly\nin banter, though it may be concerned either with\nwords or deeds. If concerned with the latter, it\nclosely resembles while the following\npassage from Terence will illustrate it as applied\nto words We may, however, imitate our own\nwords and deeds in a similar fashion by relating some act or statement, though in such cases the speaker\nmore frequently does so to assert his point than for\nthe sake of banter, as, for example, in the following, There are other devices also which\nare agreeable in themselves and serve not a little\nto commend our case both by the introduction of\nvariety and by their intrinsic naturalness, since by\ngiving our speech an appearance of simplicity and\nspontaneity they make the judges more ready to\naccept our statements without suspicion. Thus we\nmay feign repentance for what we have said, as in\nthe pro Caelio, where Cicero says, Or we may\nuse some common phrase, such as, Or we may pretend that we are\nsearching for what we should say, as in the phrases, or Or we may pretend to discover something\nsuggested by the context, as when Cicero says, or Such\nmethods will also provide us with elegant transitions,\nalthough transition is not itself to be ranked among\nfigures for example, Cicero, after telling the story\nof Piso, who ordered a goldsmith to make a ring\nbefore him in court, adds, as though this story had\nsuggested it to him, Or we may affect ignorance on certain\npoints, as in the following passage This device\nmay serve for other purposes as well. For there\nare means of this kind whereby we may achieve\nan end quite other than that at which we appear\nto be aiming, as, for example, Cicero does in the\npassage just quoted. For while he taunts Verres\nwith a morbid passion for acquiring statues and\npictures, he succeeds in creating the impression\nthat he personally has no interest in such subjects.\nSo, too, when Demosthenes swears by those who\nfell at Marathon and Salamis, his object is to lessen\nthe odium in which he was involved by the disaster\nat Chaeronea. We may further lend charm to our\nspeech by deferring the discussion of some points\nafter just mentioning them, thus depositing them\nin the safe keeping of the judge's memory and afterwards reclaiming our deposit; or we may employ\nsome figure to enable us to repeat certain points\nfor repetition is not in itself a figure or may make\nespecial mention of certain things and vary the\naspect of our pleading. For eloquence delights\nin variety, and just as the eye is more strongly\nattracted by the sight of a number of different\nthings, so oratory supplies a continuous series of\nnovelties to rivet the attention of the mind. Emphasis may be numbered among figures also,\nwhen some hidden meaning is extracted from some\nphrase, as in the following passage from Virgil For although Dido complains of marriage, yet her passionate outburst shows that she regards life without wedlock as no life for man, but for the beasts\nof the field. A different kind of emphasis is found\nin Ovid, where Zmyrna confesses to her nurse her\npassion for her father in the following words Similar, if not identical with this figure is another,\nwhich is much in vogue at the present time. For\nI must now proceed to the discussion of a class of\nfigure which is of the commonest occurrence and\non which I think I shall be expected to make\nsome comment. It is one whereby we excite some\nsuspicion to indicate that our meaning is other than\nour words would seem to imply; but our meaning\nis not in this case contrary to that which we express,\nas is the case in ironq, but rather a hidden meaning\nwhich is left to the hearer to discover. As I have\nalready pointed out, modern rhetoricians practically\nrestrict the name of figure to this device, from the\nuse of which figured controversial themes derive\ntheir name. This class of figure may be employed under three conditions first, if it is unsafe\nto speak openly; secondly, if it is unseemly to speak\nopenly; and thirdly, when it is employed solely\nwith a view to the elegance of what we say, and\ngives greater pleasure by reason of the novelty and\nvariety thus introduced than if our meaning had\nbeen expressed in straightforward language. The first of the three is of common occurrence in\nthe schools, where we imagine conditions laid down\nby tyrants on abdication and decrees passed by the\nsenate after a civil war, and it is a capital offence\nto accuse a person with what is past, what is not expedient in the courts being actually prohibited\nin the schools. But the conditions governing the\nemployment of figures differ in the two cases. For\nwe may speak against the tyrants in question as\nopenly as we please without loss of effect, provided always that what we say is susceptible of a\ndifferent interpretation, since it is only danger to\nourselves, and not offence to them, that we have to\navoid. And if the danger can be avoided by any\nambiguity of expression, tile speaker's cunning will\nmeet with universal approbation. On the other\nhand, the actual business of the courts has never\nyet involved such necessity for silence, though at\ntimes they require something not unlike it, which\nis much more embarrassing for the speaker, as, for\nexample, when he is hampered by the existence of\npowerful personages, whom he must censure if\nhe is to prove his case. Consequently he must\nproceed with greater wariness and circumspection;\nsince the actual manner in which offence is given\nis a matter of indifference, and if a figure is perfectly\nobvious, it ceases to be a figure. Therefore such\ndevices are absolutely repudiated by some authorities, whether the meaning of the figure be intelligible or not. But it is possible to employ such\nfiguress in moderation, the primary consideration\nbeing that they should not be too obvious. And\nthis fault can be avoided, if the figre does not\ndepend on the employment of words of doubtful\nor double meaning, such, for instance, as the words\nwhich occur in the theme of the suspected daughter-in-law It is important, too, that the figure should not depend on ambiguous collocations of words a\ntrick which is far more foolish than the last; an\nexample of this is to be found in the controversial\ntheme, where a father, accused of a criminal passion\nfor his unmarried daughter, asks her for the name\nof her ravisher. he says.\nShe replies The facts themselves must be allowed to excite the\nsuspicions of the judge, and we must clear away all\nother points, leaving nothing save what will suggest\nthe truth. In doing this we shall find emotional\nappeals, hesitation and words broken by silences\nmost effective. For thus the judge will be led to\nseek out the secret which he would not perhaps\nbelieve if he heard it openly stated, and to believe\nin that which he thinks he has found out for himself.\nBut however excellent our figures, they must not be\ntoo numerous. For overcrowding will make them\nobvious, and they will become ineffective without\nbecoming inoffensive, while the fact that we make\nno open accusation will seem to be due not to\nmodesty, but to lack of confidence in our own cause.\nIn fact, we may sum up the position thus our\nfigures will have most effect upon the judge when\nhe thinks that we use them with reluctance. I\nmyself have come across persons whom it was impossible to convince by other means I have even\ncome across a much rarer thing, namely, a case\nwhich could only be proved by recourse to such\ndevices. I was defending a woman who was alleged\nto have forged her husband's will, and the heirs\nwere stated to have given a bond to the husband\non his deathbed, which latter assertion was true.\nFor since the wife could not legally be appointed his heir, this procedure was adopted to enable the\nproperty to be transferred to her by a secret conveyance in trust. Now it was easy for me to secure\nthe woman's acquittal, by openly mentioning the\nexistence of the bond; but this would have involved\nher loss of the inheritance. I had, therefore, to plead\nin such a way that the judges should understand that\nthe bond had actually been given, but that informers\nmight be unable to avail themselves of any statement of mine to that effect. And I was successful\nin both my aims. The fear of seeming to boast my\nown skill would have deterred me from mentioning\nthis case, but for the fact that I wished to demonstrate that there was room for the employment of\nthese figures even in the courts. Some things,\nagain, which cannot be proved, may, on the other\nhand, be suggested by the employment of some\nfigure. For at times such hidden shafts will stick,\nand the fact that they are not noticed will prevent\ntheir being drawn out, whereas if the same point\nwere stated openly, it would be denied by our\nopponents and would have to be proved. When, however, it is respect for some person that\nhampers us which I mentioned as the second condition under which such figures may be used, all\nthe greater caution is required because the sense of\nshame is a stronger deterrent to all good men than\nfear. In such cases the judge must be impressed\nwith the fact that we are hiding what we know and\nkeeping back the words which our natural impulse\nto speak out the truth would cause to burst from\nour lips. For those against whom we are speaking,\ntogether with the judges and our audience, would assuredly be all the more incensed by such toying\nwith detraction, if they thought that we were\ninspired by deliberate malice. And what difference\ndoes it make how we express ourselves, when both\nthe facts and our feelings are clearly understood\nAnd what good shall we do by expressing ourselves thus except to make it clear that we are\ndoing what we ourselves know ought not to be done\nAnd yet in the days when I first began to teach\nrhetoric, this failing was only too common. For\ndeclaimers selected by preference those themes\nwhich attracted them by their apparent difficulty,\nalthough as a matter of fact they were much easier\nthan many others. For straightforward eloquence\nrequires the highest gifts to commend itself to\nthe audience, while these circuitous and indirect\nmethods are merely the refuge of weakness, for those\nwho use them are like men who, being unable to\nescape from their pursuers by speed, do so by\ndoubling, since this method of expression, which\nis so much affected, is really not far removed from\njesting. Indeed it is positively assisted by the\ntact that the hearer takes pleasure in detecting\nthe speaker's concealed meaning, applauds his own\npenetration and regards another man's eloquence as\na compliment to himself. Consequently it was not\nmerely in cases where respect for persons prevented\ndirect speaking a circumstance which as a rule calls\nfor caution rather than figures that they would\nhave recourse to figurative methods, but they made\nroom for them even under circumstances where they\nwere useless or morally inadmissible, as for example\nin a case where a father, who had secretly slain his\nson whom he suspected of incest with his mother, and was accused of ill-treating his wife, was made to\nbring indirect insinuations against his wife. But\nwhat could be more discreditable to the accused than\nthat he should have kept such a wife What could\nbe more damaging than that he who is accused\nbecause he appears to have harboured the darkest\nsuspicions against his wife, should by his defence\nconfirm the charge which he is required to refute\nIf such speakers had only placed themselves in the\nposition of the judges, they would have realised how\nlittle disposed they would have been to put up with\npleading on such lines, more especially in cases\nwhere the most abominable crimes were insinuated\nagainst parents. However, since we have lighted on this topic, let\nus devote a little more time to considering the\npractice of the schools. For it is in the schools that\nthe orator is trained, and the methods adopted in\npleading ultimately depend on the methods employed\nin declamation. I must therefore say something\nof those numerous cases in which figures have been\nemployed which were not merely harsh, but actually\ncontrary to the interests of the case. Everyone who pleaded for the\nfather indulged in figurative insinuations against the\nson, on the assumption that the father would, when\ntortured, be likely to name him as one of his accomplices. But what could be more foolish For as soon as the judges grasp their point, they will either\nrefuse to put him to the torture in view of his\nmotive for desiring to be tortured, or will refuse to\nbelieve any confession he may make under torture.\nBut, it will be urged, it is possible that this was his\nmotive. May be. But he should then disguise his\nmotive, in order that he may effect his purpose.\nBut what will it profit us and by us I mean\nthe declaimers to have realised this motive, unless\nwe declare it as well Well, then, if the case\nwere being actually pleaded in the courts, should we\nhave disclosed this secret motive in such a way\nAgain, if this is not the real motive, the condemned\nman may have other reasons for opposing his son;\nhe may think that the law should be carried out\nor be unwilling to accept such a kindness from the\nhands of his accuser, or and this is the line on which\nI personally should insist he may intend to persist\nin declaring his innocence even under torture.\nConsequently the usual excuse advanced by such\ndeclaimers to the effect that the inventor of the\ntheme meant the defence to proceed on these lines,\nwill not always serve their purpose. It is possible\nthat this was not the inventor's wish. However, let\nus assume that it was. Are we then to speak like\nfools merely because he thought like a fool Personally I hold that, even in actual cases, we should\noften disregard the wishes of the litigant. Further,\nin such cases speakers fall into the frequent error of\nassuming that certain persons say one thing and\nmean another this is more especially the case where\nit is assumed that a man asks permission to die.\nTake, for example, the following controversial theme. they say, For my part, I laugh at the fears which they manifest\non his behalf, as though they were in peril of death\nthemselves, and at the way in which they allow their\nterror to influence their line of pleading; for they\nforget how many precedents there are for suicide\nand how many reasons there may be why a hero\nturned deserter should wish for death. But it would\nbe waste of time to expatiate on one controversial\ntheme. I would lay it down as a general rule that an\norator should never put forward a plea that is tantamount to collusion, and I cannot imagine a lawsuit\narising in which both parties have the same design,\nnor conceive that any man who wishes to live could\nbe such a fool as to put forward an absurd plea for\ndeath, when he might refrain from pleading for it at\nall. I do not, however, deny that there are controversial themes of this kind where figures may\nlegitimately be employed, as, for example, the\nfollowing For in this case he does not pardon his son\nentirely, but cannot openly withdraw the evidence\nthat he gave in the first trial, and while he does not\ninflict any worse penalty than disinheritance, he does\nnot shrink from that. Further, the employment of\nthe figure tells more heavily against the father than\nis fair and less against the son. But, while no one\never speaks against the view which he wishes to\nprevail, he may wish something of greater importance than what he actually says. Thus the\ndisinherited son who asks his father to take back\nanother son whom he had exposed, and who had\nbeen brought up by himself, on payment for his\nmaintenance, while he may prefer that he himself\nshould be reinstated, may all the same be perfectly\nsincere in his demand on behalf of his brother.\nAgain, a kind of tacit hint may be employed, which,\nwhile demanding the utmost rigour of the law from\nthe judges, suggests a loophole for clemency, not\nopenly, for that would imply a pledge on our part,\nbut by giving a plausible suspicion of our meaning.\nThis device is employed in a number of controversial\nthemes, among them the following. Here if the father pledges himself to\npardon him, the dispute falls to the ground. If, on\nthe other hand, he holds out no hope of pardon,\nthough he will not necessarily be regarded as mad,\nhe will certainly give the impression of cruelty and\nwill prejudice the judge against him. Latro therefore showed admirable skill when he made the son\nsay, and the father reply, The elder Gallio treats the theme\nwith greater tenderness, as was natural to a man of\nhis disposition. He makes the father say, Akin to this are those figures of\nwhich the Greeks are so fond, by means of which\nthey give gentle expression to unpleasing facts.\nThemistocles, for example, is believed to have urged\nthe Athenians to commit their city to the protection\nof heaven, because to urge them to abandon it would\nhave been too brutal an expression. Again the\nstatesman who advised that certain golden images\nof Victory should be melted down as a contribution\nto the war funds, modified his words by saying that\nthey should make a proper use of their victories.\nBut all such devices which consist in saying one\nthing, while intending something else to be understood, have a strong resemblance to allegory. It has also been asked how figures may best be\nmet. Some hold that they should always be\nexposed by the antagonist, just as hidden ulcers\nare laid open by the surgeon. It is true that\nthis is often the right course, being the only means\nof refuting the charges which have been brought\nagainst us, and this is more especially the case\nwhen the question turns on the very point at which\nthe figures are directed. But when the figures are\nmerely employed as vehicles of abuse, it will sometimes even be wisest to show that we have a clear\nconscience by ignoring them. Nay, even if too\nmany figures have been used to permit us to take\nsuch a course, we may ask our opponents, if they have any confidence in the righteousness of their\ncause, to give frank and open expression to the\ncharges which they have attempted to suggest by\nindirect hints, or at any rate to refrain from asking\nthe judges not merely to understand, but even to\nbelieve things which they themselves are afraid to\nstate in so many words. It may even at times be\nfound useful to pretend to misunderstand them; for\nwhich we may compare the well known story of the\nman who, when his opponent cried, replied that he was\nready to do so, whereupon the judge accepted the\nproposal, much to the indignation of the advocate,\nwho protested that this would make the use of\nfigures absolutely impossible; we may therefore lay\nit down as a general rule that such figures should\nonly be used with the utmost caution. There remains the third class of figure designed\nmerely to enhance the elegance of our style, for\nwhich reason Cicero expresses the opinion that such\nfigures are independent of the subject in dispute.\nAs an illustration I may quote the figure which he\nuses in his speech against Clodius Irony also is frequently employed in\nthis connexion. But by far the most artistic device is to indicate one thing by allusion to another; take\nthe case where a rival candidate speaks against an\nex-tyrant who had abdicated on condition of his\nreceiving an amnesty Another common device is to introduce an\noath, like the speaker who, in defending a disinherited man, cried, But this is not a figure which\nis much to be recommended, for as a rule the\nintroduction of an oath, unless it is absolutely\nnecessary, is scarcely becoming to a self-respecting\nman. Seneca made a neat comment to this\neffect when he said that oaths were for the\nwitness and not for the advocate. Again, the\nadvocate who drags in an oath merely for the sake\nof some trivial rhetorical effect, does not deserve\nmuch credit, unless he can do this with the\nmasterly effect achieved by Demosthenes, which I\nmentioned above. But by far the most trivial form\nof figure is that which turns on a single word,\nalthough we find such a figure directed against\nClodia by Cicero I note that comparison is also regarded as a figure,\nalthough at times it is a form of proof, and at others\nthe whole case may turn upon it, while its form\nmay be illustrated by the following passage from the pro Murena and so on. I am not sure, however, whether it is so much a figure of thought as of\nspeech. For the only difference lies in the fact that\nuniversals are not contrasted with universals, but\nparticulars with particulars. Celsus, however, and\nthat careful writer Visellius regard it as a figure of\nthought, while Rutilius Lupus regards it as belonging\nto both, and calls it antithesis. To the figures placed by Cicero among the ornaments of thought Rutilius following the views of\nGorgias, a contemporary, whose four books he\ntransferred to his own work, and who is not to be\nconfused with Georgias of Leontini and Celsus\nwho follows Rutilius would add a number of\nothers, such as concentration, which the Greek calls a term employed when a number of\ndifferent arguments are used to establish one point\nconsequence, which Gorgias calls and\nwhich I have already discussed under the head\nof argument inference, which Gorgias terms threats, that is, exhortation,\nor But all of these are perfectly\nstraightforward methods of speaking, unless combined with some one of the figures which I have\ndiscussed above. Besides these, Celsus considers\nthe following to be figures exclusion, asseveration,\nrefusal, excitement of the judge, the use of\nproverbs, the employment of quotations from poetry,\njests, invidious remarks or invocation to intensify a\ncharge which is identical with  flattery, pardon, disdain, admonition, apology, entreaty and\nrebuke. He even includes partition, proposition,\ndivision and affinity between two separate things,\nby which latter he means that two things\napparently different signify the same for example,\nnot only the man who murders another by administering a deadly draught is to be regarded as\na poisoner, but also the man who deprives another\nof his wits by giving him some drug, a point which\ndepends on definition. To these Rutilius or\nGorgias add that is, the representation\nof the necessity of a thing, or reminding, that is, replying to anticipated objections, or refutation, or\namplification, which means pointing out\nwhat ought to have been done, and then what\nactually has been done, or arguments\nfrom opposites whence we get enthymemes styled\n, and even which Hermagoras considers a basis. Visellius, although he\nmakes the number of figures but small, includes\namong them the enthymeme, which he calls\ncommentum, and the epicheireme, which he calls ratio.\nThis view is also partially accepted by Celsus, who\nis in doubt whether consequence is not to be identified with the epicheireme. Visellius also adds\ngeneral reflexions to the list. I find others who\nwould add to these or enhancement, or prohibition, and or\nincidental narrative. But though these are not\nfigures, there may be others which have slipped\nmy notice, or are yet to be invented still, they\nwill be of the same nature as those of which I have\nspoken above. III. Figures of speech have always been liable to\nchange and are continually in process of change in\naccordance with the variations of usage. Consequently when we compare the language of our\nancestors with our own, we find that practically everything we say nowadays is figurative. For example,\nwe say invidere hac re for to instead of hanc rem, which was the idiom of all the\nancients, more especially Cicero, and incumbere illi\nto lean upon him for incumbere in ilium, plenum vino\nfull of wine for plenum vini, and huic adulari to flatter\nhim for hunc adulari. I might quote a thousand\nother examples, and only wish I could say that the\nchanges were not often changes for the worse. But\nto proceed, figures of speech fall into two main\nclasses. One is defined as the form of language,\nwhile the other is mainly to be sought in the\narrangement of words. Both are equally applicable\nin oratory, but we may style the former rather more\ngrammatical and the latter more rhetorical.\nThe former originates from the same sources as\nerrors of language. For every figure of this kind\nwould be an error, if it were accidental and not\ndeliberate. But as a rule such figures are defended by\nauthority, age and usage, and not infrequently by some\nreason as well. Consequently, although they involve\na divergence from direct and simple language, they\nare to be regarded as excellences, provided always\nthat they have some praiseworthy precedent to\nfollow. They have one special merit, that they relieve the tedium of everyday stereotyped speech and\nsave us from commonplace language. If a speaker\nuse them sparingly and only as occasion demands,\nthey will serve as a seasoning to his style and increase its attractions. If, on the other hand, he\nstrains after them overmuch, he will lose that very\ncharm of variety which they confer. Some figures,\nhowever, are so generally accepted that they have\nalmost ceased to be regarded as figures consequently\nhowever frequently they may be used, they will\nmake less impression on the ear, just because it has\nbecome habituated to them. For abnormal figures\nlying outside the range of common speech, while\nthey are for that very reason more striking, and\nstimulate the ear by their novelty, prove cloying if\nused too lavishly, and make it quite clear that they\ndid not present themselves naturally to the speaker,\nbut were hunted out by him, dragged from obscure\ncorners and artificially piled together.\nFigures, then, may be found in connexion with the\ngender of nouns; for we find oculis capti talpale\nblind moles and timidi damae timid deer in Virgil;\nbut there is good reason for this, since in these\ncases both sexes are covered by a word of one gender,\nand there is no doubt that there are male moles\nand deer as well as female. Figures may also affect\nverbs for example, we find such phrases as fabricatus\nest glatdium or inimicum poenitus es. This is the less\nsurprising, since the nature of verbs is such that we\noften express the active by the passive form, as in the\ncase of arbitror think and suspicor suspect, and\nthe passive by the active, as in the case of vapulo\nam beaten. Consequently the interchange of the\ntwo forms is of common occurrence, and in many\ncases either form can be used for example, we may\nsay luxuriatur or luxuriat luxuriate, fluctuatur or\nfluctuat fluctuate, adsentior or adsentio agree.\nFigures also occur in connexion with number, as when the plural follows the singular, as in the\nphrase gladio pugnacissima gens Romani the Romans\nare a nation that fight fiercely with the sword; for\ngens is a singular noun indicating multitude. Or the\nsingular may follow the plural, as in the following\ninstance, where etc., is included\namong etc. In a\nsatire again we read, where the infinitive is used as a noun for the poet\nby nostrum vivere means nostram vitam. We also at\ntimes use the verb for the participle, as in the phrase, where ferre is used for ferendum, or the participle\nmay be used for the verb, as in the phrase volo datum\nI wish to give. At times, again, there may be some doubt as\nto the precise error which a figure resembles. Take,\nfor example, the phrase where the writer has either changed the parts of\nspeech making his phrase a variant for virtus est fuga vitiorum, or the cases in which case it will be\na variant for virtutis est vitium fugere; but whichever\nbe the case, the figure is far more vigorous than\neither. At times figures are joined, as in Sthenelus\nsciens pugnae, which is substituted for Sthenelus scilus\npugnandi. Tenses too are interchangeable. For\nexample, Timarchides negat esse ei periculum a seuri\nthe present negat is substituted for the past. Or\none mood may be used for another, as in the phrase,\nhoc Ithacus velit. In fact, to cut a long matter short,\nthere is a figure corresponding to every form of\nsolecism. There is also a figure styled i.e. alteration of the normal idiom, which bears a strong\nresemblance to For example, we find in\nSallust phrases such as neque ea res failsum me habuit\nand duci probare. Such figures as a rule aim not\nmerely at novelty, but at conciseness as well.\nHence we get further developments, such as non\npaeniturum for and visuros\nfor both found in the same author.\nThese may have been figures when Sallust made\nthem; but it is a question whether they can now be\nso considered, since they have met with such general\nacceptance. For we are in the habit of accepting\ncommon parlance as sufficient authority where current\nphrases are concerned for example, rebus agentibus\nin the sense of while this was going on, which\nPollio rebukes Labienus for using, has become an\naccredited idiom, as has contumeliam fecit, which, as is well known, is stigmatised by Cicero for in his day\nthey said ad fici contumelia. Figures may also be\ncommended by their antiquity, for which Virgil had\nsuch a special passion. Compare his or Numerous instances of the same kind might be cited\nfrom the old tragic and comic poets. One word of\nthis type has remained in common use, namely\nenimvero. I might further quote from the same\nauthor words which form the beginning of a speech or There the sentence inverts the natural order which\nmay be illustrated by quam magis aerumna urgent, tam\nmagis ad malefaciendumn viget. Old writers are full of such usages. At the beginning of the Eunuchus of Terence we have quid\nigitur faciam, while another comic poet says ain\ntandem leno Catullus in his Epithalamium writes where the first dum means while, and the second\nmeans so long. Sallust, on the other hand, borrows\na number of idioms from the Greek, such as\nvulgus amat fieri the same is true of Horace, who\nstrongly approves of the practice. Compare his Virgil does the same in phrases such as or saucius pectus , an idiom\nwhich has now become familiar in the public gazette.\nUnder the same class of figure falls that of\naddition, which, although the words added may be\nstrictly superfluous, may still be far from inelegant.\nTake, for example, where the second nam might be omitted. And we\nfind in Horace, Similarly, words are omitted, a device which may be\neither a blemish or a figure, according to the context.\nThe following is an example for the full phrase would be plus quam satis. There\nis, however, another form of omission which requires\ntreatment at greater length. We frequently use the comparative for the\npositive, as, for example, when a man speaks of\nhimself as being infirmior rather indisposed.\nSometimes we join two comparatives, as in the\nfollowing passage si te, Catilina, comprehend, si\ninterfici iussero, credo erit verendum mihi, ne non potius\nhoc ones boni serius a me qam quisquam crudelius\nfactum esse dicat. There are also figures like the\nfollowing, which, though far from being solecisms,\nalter the number and are also usually included\namong tropes. We may speak of a single thing in\nthe plural, as in the following instance Or we may speak of the plural in the singular, as in\nthe following case There are others which belong to a diflfrent\nspecies, but the same genus, such as or For in the first of these passages he is not advising\nsome other person, nor exhorting himself in the\nsecond, his advice in both passages being meant for\nall. Sometimes, again, we speak of ourselves as\nthough we were referring to others, as in phrases\nlike, At\nother times we speak in the first person instead of\nin another, or substitute one person for another.\nBoth devices are employed together in the pro\nCaecina, where Cicero, addressing Piso, the counsel\nfor the prosecution, says, The actual truth is that\nit was Aebutius who asserted that he had reinstated the defendant, and Caecina who denied that\nhe had been restored in accordance with the\npraetor's edict. We may note also a further figure\nof speech in the contracted dixti, which has dropped\none of its syllables. The following also may be regarded as belonging to the same genus. The first\nis called interpositio or interclusio by us, and parenthesis\nor paremptosis by the Greeks, and consists in the\ninterruption of the continuous flow of our language\nby the insertion of some remark. The following\nis an example ego cum te mecum enim saepissime\nloquilur patriae reddidissem. To this they add\nhyperbaton, which they refuse to include among\ntropes. A second figure of this kind is one closely\nresembling the figure of thought known as apostrophe,\nbut differing in this respect, that it changes the\nform of the language and not the sense. The\nfollowing will illustrate my meaning There is a still more striking example in the passage\ndescribing the death of Polydorus 'Those terminologists who delight in subtle distinctions call the last figure transition, and\nhold that it may be employed in yet another way,\nas in Dido's Virgil has combined apostrollphe and parenthesis in\nthe well-known passage These figures and the like, which consist in change,\naddition, omission, and the order of words, serve to\nattract the attention of the audience and do not\nallow it to flag, rousing it from time to time by some\nspecially striking figure, while they derive something\nof their charm from their very resemblance to\nblemishes, just as a trace of bitterness in food will\nsometimes tickle the palate. But this result will\nonly be obtained if figures are not excessive in\nnumber nor all of the same type or combined or\nclosely packed, since economy in their use, no less\nthan variety, will prevent the hearer being surfeited. There is a more striking class of figure, which does\nnot merely depend on the form of the language for\nits effect, but lends both charm and force to the\nthought as well. The first figure of this class which\ncalls for notice is that which is produced by addition.\nOf this there are various kinds. Words, for instance,\nmay be doubled with a view to amplification, as in where the first I have slain states what has been\ndone, while the second emphasises it, or to excite\npity, as in The same figure may also sometimes be employed\nironically, with a view to disparagement. Similar to\nsuch doubling of words is repetition following a\nparenthesis, but the effect is stronger. Again, a number of clauses may begin\nwith the same word for the sake of force and emphasis. Or\nthey may end with the same words. This last instance, however, comes under\nthe head of another figure as well, where both\nopening and concluding words are identical, since\nthe sentences open with and end with Here is another example. Again, in antitheses and comparisons the first words of alternate phrases are\nfrequently repeated to produce correspondence,\nwhich was my reason for saying a little while back\nthat this device came under the present topic rather\nthan that which I was then discussing. But the orator is not content with producing this effect, but proceeds to reverse the figure. A similar correspondence may be\nproduced between the middle and the opening of a\nsentence, as in the line Or the middle may correspond to the end, as in the\nfollowing sentence Nor will it be questioned that a like effect may be\nproduced by the repetition of the middle of both\nclauses. Again, the end may correspond with the\nbeginning. There is also\nanother form of repetition which simultaneously\nreiterates things that have already been said, and\ndraws distinctions between them. This is styled by the Greeks and regression\nby Roman writers. Nor are words only repeated to\nreaffirm the same meaning, but the repetition may\nserve to mark a contrast, as in the following sentence. At times the cases and genders of the\nwords repeated may be varied, as in ; a similar\ninstance is found in Rutilius, but in a long period.\nI therefore merely cite the beginnings of the clauses.\nPater hic tuus patrem nunc appellas patris tui filius\nes This figure may also be effected solely by\nchange of cases, a proceeding which the Greeks call It may also be produced in other ways,\nas in the pro Cluentio Quod autem tempus veneni dandi\nillo die illa frequentia per quem porro datum unde\nsumptum quae porro interceptio poculi cur non de\nintegro autem datum The combination of different\ndetails is called by Caecilius, and may be\nexemplified by the following passage directed against\nOppianicus in the pro Cluentio with much more to the same effect. In this case the\ndetails are massed together, but they may equally be\ndistributed or dissipated, as I think Cicero says. For\nexample with the remainder of the passage. A wonderful mixture of figures may be found in Cicero in the\nfollowing passage, where the first word is repeated\nlast after a long interval, while the middle corresponds with the beginning, and the concluding words\nwith the middle. This frequent repetition, which, as I have said, is\nproduced by a mixture of figures, is called by\nthe Greeks a letter of Cicero to Brutus will provide a further example. etc. The like effect may be produced\nin the same sentence by repeating the same words\nin different forms, as in Persius and in Cicero, where he says, Whole sentences again end\nwith the phrase with which they began. Take an\nexample. Nay, the first word of this same period is actually repeated at its close, thus making its third appearance\nfor to the words just quoted the orator adds, Sometimes a whole clause is\nrepeated, although the order of the words is altered,\nas, for example, Quid Cleomenes facere potuit non\nenin possum quemquam insimulare falso, quid, inquam, magno opere potuit Cleomenes facere The first word\nof one clause is also frequently the same as the last\nof the preceding, a figure common in poetry. But it is not uncommon even in the orators. For\nexample Sometimes, as I\nremarked in connexion with the doubling of words,\nthe beginnings and the conclusions of sentences are\nmade to correspond by the use of other words with\nthe same meaning. Here is an example of correspondence between the beginnings An example of the\ncorrespondence of conclusions is provided by another\npassage in the same speech which follows close on\nthat just cited Some\ncall this synonzmy, others disjunction both terms,\ndespite their difference, are correct. For the words\nare differentiated, but their meaning is identical.\nSometimes, again, words of the same meaning are\ngrouped together. For instance, Or take this example from another book of the\norations against Catiline, This is regarded as a case of pleonasm by Caecilius, that is to\nsay, as language fuller than is absolutely required,\nlike the phrase for is already implied by But\nwhen such language is over weighted by some purely\nsuperfluous addition, it is, as I have also pointed out\nelsewhere, a fault; whereas when, as in this case, it\nserves to make the sense stronger and more obvious,\nit is a merit. are so many appeals to the emotion. I cannot\ntherefore see why Caecilius should have stigmatised\nthese words by such a name, since the doubling and\nrepetition of words and all forms of addition may likewise be regarded aspleonasms. And it is not merely\nwords that are thus grouped together. The same\ndevice may be applied to thoughts of similar content. Words of different meaning may likewise be\ngrouped together, as for instance, ;\nor again, as in the following passage from Ovid, I have found some who call this also by the name\nof but I do not agree, as only one figure is involved. We may also find a mixture of words,\nsome identical and others different in meaning; of\nthis figure, which the Greeks style the\nfollowing will provide an example In this sentence and are different\nin meaning, while and are similar in meaning to each other,\nbut different from the three previous. But both the\nlast example and the last but one involve a different\nfigure as well, which, owing to the absence of\nconnecting particles, is called dissolution asyndeton,\nand is useful when we are speaking with special\nvigour for it at once impresses the details on the\nmind and makes them seem more numerous than\nthey really are. Consequently, we apply this\nfigure not merely to single words, but to whole\nsentences, as, for instance, is done by Cicero in his\nreply to the speech which Metellus made to\nthe public assembly while the rest of the passage is constructed\non similar lines. This kind of figure is also called\nbrachylogy, which may be regarded as detachment\nwithout loss of connexion. The opposite of this\nfigure of asyndeton is polyxyndeton, which is characterised by the number of connecting particles employed.\nIn this figure we may repeat the same connecting\nparticle a number of times, as in the following instance or they may be different, as in the case of arma\nvirumque followed by multum ille et terris and multa\nquoque. Adverbs and pronouns also may be varied,\nas in the following instance lic ilium vidi iunvenem\nfollowed by bis senos cui nostra dies and  hic mihi\nresponsum primus dedit ille petenti. But both these\ncases involve the massing together of words and\nphrases either in asyndeton or polysyndeton. Writers\nhave given special names to all the different forms,\nbut the names vary with the caprice of the inventor.\nThe origin of these figures is one and the same,\nnamely that they make our utterances more vigorous\nand emphatic and produce animpression of vehemence\nsuch as might spring from repeated outbursts of\nemotion. Gradation, which the Greeks call climax, necessitates a more obvious and less natural application of\nart and should therefore be more sparingly employed.\nMoreover, it involves addition, since it repeats what\nhas already been said and, before passing to a new\npoint, dwells on those which precede. I will translate a very famous instance from the Greek. There are, however, examples of the same thing in Latin authors. Calvus\nagain writes, etc. It is also to be found in poets,\nas in the passage in Homer describing the sceptre\nwhich he traces from the hands of Jupiter down to\nthose of Agamemnon, and in the following from one\nof our own tragedians As regards the figures produced by omission, they\nrely for their charm in the main on conciseness and\nnovelty. There is one of these which I mentioned\nin the last book with reference to synecdoche, and\npostponed discussing until such time as I came to\ndeal with figures it occurs when the word omitted\nmay be clearly gathered from the context an\nexample may be found in Caelius' denunciation of\nAntony stupere gaudio Graecus for we must clearly\nsupply coepit. Or take the following passage from a\nletter of Cicero to Brutus Serno nullus scilicet nisi\nde te quid enim potius turn Flavius, cras, inquit,\ntabellarii, et ego ibidem has inter cenum exaravi. Of a\nsimilar kind, at any rate in my opinion, are those\npassages in which words are decently omitted to\nspare our modesty. Some regard this as an aposiopesis, but wrongly.\nFor in aposiopesis it is either uncertain or at least\nrequires an explanation of some length to show what\nis suppressed, whereas in the present case only one\nword, and that of an obvious character, is missing.\nIf this, then, is an aposiopesis, all omissions will have\na claim to the title. I would not even allow the\nname of aposiopesis to all cases where what is omitted\nis left to be understood, as for example the following phrase from Cicero's letters, Data Lupercalibus\nquo die Antonius Caesari for there, there is no real\nsuppression the omission is merely playful, for there\nis but one way of completing the sentence, namely\nwith the words diadema imposuit. Another figure\nproduced by omission is that of which I have just\nspoken, when the connecting particles are omitted.\nA third is the figure known as in which\na number of clauses are all completed by the same\nverb, which would be required by each singly if they\nstood alone. In such cases the verb to which the\nrest of the sentence refers may come first, as in the\nfollowing instance Vicit pudorem lilido, timiorem\naudacia, rationem amentia. Or it may come last,\nclosing a number of clauses, as in the following\nNeque enim is es, Catilina, ut te aut pudor unquam a\nturpitudine ant meites a periculo aut ratio a furore revocaverit. The verb may even be placed in the middle\nso as to serve both what precedes and what follows.\nThe same figure may join different sexes, as for\nexample when we speak of a male and female child\nunder the comprehensive term of ; or it may interchange singular and plural. But these devices\nare so common that they can scarcely lay claim to\ninvolve the art essential to figures. On the other\nhand it is quite obviously figure, when two different\nconstructions are combined as in the following case I bid my comrades straight to seize their arms\nAnd war be waged against a savage race. For although the portion of the sentence following\nbellum ends with a participle, both clauses of the\nsentence are correctly governed by edico. Another\nform of connexion, which does not necessarily involve\nomission, is called because it connects\ntwo different things, for example To this figure is opposed distinction, which they call by which we distinguish between\nsimilar things, as in this sentence But this is entirely\ndependent on definition, and therefore I have my\ndoubts whether it can be called a figure. Its opposite\noccurs when we pass at a bound from one thing to\nsomething different, as though from like to like; for\nexample with what follows. There is a third class of figures which attracts the\near of the audience and excites their attention by\nsome resemblance, equality or contrast of words.\nTo this class belongs paronomasia, which we call\nadnominatio. This may be effected in different ways.\nIt may depend on the resemblance of one word to\nanother which has preceded, although the words are\nin different cases. Take the following passage from\nDomitius Afer's defence of Cloatilla Mulier omnium\nrerum imiperita, in omnnibus rebus infelix. Or the same\nword may be repeated with greater meaning, as\nquando homo, hostis homno. But although I have used\nthese examples to illustrate something quite different,\none of them involves both emphasis and reiteration.\nThe opposite of parononasia occurs when one word is\nproved to be false by repetition; for instance, Akin to this is that syled where the\nsame word is used in two different meanings. When\nProculeius reproached his son with waiting for his\ndeath, and the son replied that he was not waiting\nfor it, the former retorted, Well then, I ask you to\nwait for it. Sometimes such difference in meaning\nis obtained not by using the same word, but one like\nit, as for example by saying that a man whom you\nthink dignus supplicatione worthy of supplication is\nsupplicio adficiendus. There are also other ways in\nwhich the same words may be used in different\nsenses or altered by the lengthening or shortening of a syllable this is a poor trick even when employed\nin jest, and I am surprised that it should be included\nin the text-books the instances which I quote are\ntherefore given as examples for avoidance, not for\nimitation. Here they are Amari iucundum est, si\ncuretur ne quid insit amari, and Avium dulcedo ad avium\nducit; and again this jest from Ovid, Cornificius calls this traductio, that is the transference of the meaning of one word to another. It\nhas, however, greater elegance when it is employed\nto distinguish the exact meanings of things, as in the\nfollowing example the same is true when the meaning of verbs is reversed\nby a change in the preposition with which they are\ncompounded for example, Non emissus ex urbe, sed\nimmissus in urbem esse videatur. The effect is better\nstill and more emphatic when our pleasure is derived\nboth from the figurative form and the excellence of\nthe sense, as in the following instance emit morte\nimmortalitatem. A more trivial effect is produced by\nthe following Non Pisonum, sed pistorum, and Ex\noratore arator, while phrases such as Ne patres conscripti videantur circumscripti, or raro evenit, sed vehenenter venit, are the worst of all. It does, however,\nsometimes happen that a bold and vigorous conception may derive a certain charm from the contrast\nbetween two words not dissimilar in sound. I do not know that there is any reason why modesty\nshould prevent me from illustrating this point from\nmy own family. My father, in the course of a declamation against a man who had said he would die\non his embassy and then returned after a few days'\nabsence without accomplishing anything, said, non\nexigo ut immoriaris legationi immorare. For the\nsense is forcible and the sound of the two words,\nwhich are so very different in meaning, is pleasant,\nmore especially since the assonance is not far fetched,\nbut presents itself quite naturally, one word being of\nthe speaker's own selection, while the other is supplied by his opponent. The old orators were at\ngreat pains to achieve elegance in the use of words\nsimilar or opposite in sound. Gorgias carried the\npractice to an extravagant pitch, while Isocrates, at\nany rate in his early days, was much addicted to it.\nEven Cicero delighted in it, but showed some restraint in the employment of a device which is not\nunattractive save when carried to excess, and, further,\nby the weight of his thought lent dignity to what\nwould otherwise have been mere trivialities. For\nin itself this artifice is a flat and foolish affectation,\nbut when it goes hand in hand with vigour of\nthought, it gives the impression of natural charm,\nwhich the speaker has not had to go far to find.\nThere are some four different forms of play upon\nverbal resemblances. The first occurs when we\nselect some word which is not very unlike another,\nas in the line of Virgil or, sic in hac calamitosa fama quasi in aliqua perniciosissim flamma, and non enim tarn spes laudanda quam res est. Or at any rate the words selected will be\nof equal length and will have similar terminations,\nas in non verbis, sed armis. A good effect may also\nbe produced by an artifice such as the following, so\nlong as the thought which it expresses be vigorous quantum possis, in eo semper experire ut prosis.\nThe name commonly applied to this is though the Stoic Theon thinks that in cases of the correspondence between the clauses must\nbe exact. The second form occurs when clauses\nconclude alike, the same syllables being placed at\nthe end of each; this correspondence in the ending\nof two or more sentences is called homoeoteleuton.\nHere is an example Non modo ad salutem eius exstinguendam sed etiam gloriam per tales viros infringendam.\nThis figure is usually, though not invariably, found in\nthe groups of three clauses, styled of which\nthe following may be cited as an illustration vicit\npudorem libido, timorem audacia, rationed amentia.\nBut the device may be applied to four clauses or\nmore. The effect may even be produced by single\nwords; for example, Hecuba hoc dolet, pudet, piget,\nor abiit, excessit, erupit, evasit. In the third form the\ncorrespondence is produced by the use of similar\ncases; it is known as But this name,\nthough it implies a certain similarity, does not necessarily involve identity in termination, since it means\nno more than similarity of case, irrespective of the\nfact that words may be differently declined, and does\nnot always occur at the end of a sentence; the correspondence may occur at the beginning, middle or end of clauses, or may be varied so that the middle\nof one clause corresponds with the beginning of\nanother and the end with the middle in fact, any\narrangement of correspondences is permissible. Nor\nneed the words which correspond consist of the\nsame number of syllables. For example, we find\nthe following sentence in Domitius Afer Amisso\nnuper infelicis aulae, si non praesidio inter pericula,\ntamen solacio inter adversa. The best form of this\nfigure is that in which the beginnings and ends of\nthe clauses correspond as in this case praesidio corresponds with solacio and pericula with adversa, in such\na way that there is a close resemblance between the\nwords, while cadence and termination are virtually\nidentical. It is also desirable that the clauses should\nbe of equal length, although as a matter of fact this\nforms the fourth figure of this class, and is known as The following will serve as an example,\nbeing both and Si, quantum in\nagro locisque desertis audacia potest, tantum in foro atque\niudiciis impudentia valeret; continuing, it combines and non minus\nnunc in causa cederet Aulus Caecina Sexti Aebutii imnpudentiae, quam turn in vi facienda cessit audaciae. This\npassage derives an additional elegance from the figure\nwhich I mentioned above as consisting in the repetition of words with an alteration of case, tense, mood,\netc., to be found in this instance in the words non\nminus cederet quam cessit. The following, on the other hand, combines homoeoteleuton and paronomasia\nNeminem alteri posse dare in matrinonium, nisi penes\nquem sit patrimonium. Antithesis, which Roman writers call either contrapositum or contentio, may be effected in more than one\nway. Single words may be contrasted with single, as\nin the passage recently quoted, Vicit pudorem libido,\ntimorem audacia, or the contrast may be between\npairs of words, as in non nostri ingenii, vestri auxilii est,\nor sentence may be contrasted with sentence, as in\ndominetur in contionibus, iaceat in iudiciis. Next to\nthis another form may appropriately be placed,\nnamely that which we have styled distinction and of\nwhich the following is an example Odit populus\nRomanus privaiam luxuriam, publicam magoificentiam\ndiligit. The same is true of the figure by which\nwords of similar termination, but of different\nmeaning are placed at the end of corresponding\nclauses, as in ut quod in tempore mali fuit, nihil obsit,\nquod in causa boni fruit, prosit. Nor is the contrasted\nphrase always placed immediately after that to\nwhich it is opposed, as it is in the following\ninstance est igitur haec, indices, non scripta,\nsed nala lex but, as Cicero says, we may have\ncorrespondence between subsequent particulars and\nothers previously mentioned, as in the passage which\nimmediately follows that just quoted quam non\ndidicimus, accepimus, leginmus, verum ex natura ipsa\narrptluimus, hauusimus, epressimus. Again the contrast is not always expressed antithetically, as is\nshown by the following passage from Rutilius\nnobis primis dii immortales fruges dedelunt, nos, quod\nsoli accepimus, in omnes terras distribuimus. Antithesis may also be effected by employing that figure,\nknown as by which words are repeated\nin different cases, tenses, moods, etc., as for instance\nwhen we say, non ut edam, vivo, sed ut vivam, edo I do\nnot live to eat, but eat to live. There is an instance of this in Cicero, where he has managed,\nwhile changing the case, to secure similarity of termination ut et sine inridia culpa plectatur et sine culpa\ninvidia ponatur. Again the clauses may end with\nthe same word, as when Cicero says of Sextus\nRoscius etenim cum artifex eiusmodi est ut solus videatur dignus qui in scena spectetur, turn vir eiusmodi est ut\nsolus dignus esse videatur qui eo non accedat. There\nis also a special elegance which may be secured by\nplacing names in antithesis, as in the following instance, Si consul Antonius, Brutus hostis; si conservator\nrei publicae Brutus, hostis Antonius. I have already said more than was necessary on the\nsubject of figures. But there will still be some who\nthink that the following which they call is a figure Incredibile est, quod dico, sed verum they\nsay the same of Aliquis hoc semel tubit, neno bis, ego\nter which they style , and of Longius evects\nsum, sed redeo ad propositumr, which they call There are some figures of speech which differ\nlittle from figures of thought, as for example that of\nhesitation. For when we hesitate over a thing, it\nbelongs to the former class, whereas when we hesitate over a word, it must be assigned to the latter,\nas for instance if we say, The same consideration applies to correction. For correction emends,\nwhere hesitation expresses a doubt. Some have\neven held that it applies to personification as well;\nthey think, for example, that Avarice is the mother of\ncruelly, Sallust's O Romulus of Arpinum in his speech\nagainst Cicero, and the Thriasian Oedipus of Menander are figures of speech. All these points have\nbeen discussed in full detail by those who have not\ngiven this subject merely incidental treatment as a\nportion of a larger theme, but have devoted whole\nbooks to the discussion of the topic I allude to\nwriters such as Caecilius, Dionysius, Rutilius, Cornificius, Visellius and not a few others, although there\nare living authors who will be no less famous than\nthey. Now though I am ready to admit that more\nfigures of speech may perhaps be discovered by certain\nwriters, I cannot agree that such figures are better\nthan those which have been laid down by high\nauthorities. Above all I would point out that\nCicero has included a number of figures in the third\nbook of the de Oratore, which in his later work, the\nOrator, he has omitted, thereby seeming to indicate\nthat he condemned them. Some of these are figures\nof thought rather than of speech, such as meiosis, the\nintroduction of the unexpected, imagery, answering\nour own questions, digression, permission, arguments drawn from opposites for I suppose that by contrarium he means what is elsewhere styled\n, and proof borrowed from an opponent.\nThere are some again which are not figures at all,\nsuch as arrangement, distinction by headings, and\ncircumscription, whether this latter term be intended\nto signify the concise expression of thought or\ndefinition, which is actually regarded by Cornificius\nand Rutilius as a figure of speech. With regard to\nthe elegant transposition of words, that is, hyperbaton, which Caecilius also thinks is a figure, I have\nincluded it among tropes. As for mutation of the\nkind which Rutilius calls its function is to\npoint out the differences between men, things and\ndeeds if it is used on an extended scale, it is not a\nfigure, if on a narrower scale, it is mere antithesis, while\nif it is intended to mean hypallage, enough has already\nbeen said on the subject. Again what sort of a\nfigure is this addition of a reason, for what is advanced,\nwhich Rutilius calls  It may also be\ndoubted whether the assignment of a reason for each\ndistinct statement, with which Rutilius opens his discussion of figures, is really a figure. He calls it and states that strictly it applies to a\nnumber of propositions, since the reason is either\nattached to each proposition separately, as in the\nfollowing passage from Gaius Antonius ; or, after two or three propositions have\nbeen stated, the reasons for them may be given continuously in the same order, as for example in the words that Brutus uses of Gnaeus Pompeius But a\nnumber of reasons may also be assigned for one statement, as in the lines of Virgil As to what Cicero means by reference, I am in the\ndark if he means or or I have already discussed them. But whatever its meaning may be, he does not mention it in\nthe Orator any more than the other terms I have\njust mentioned. The only figure of speech mentioned\nin that work, which I should prefer to regard as a\nfigure of thought owing to its emotional character,\nis exclamation. I agree with him about all the rest.\nTo these Caecilius adds periphrasis, of which I have\nalready spoken,5 while Cornificius adds interrogation,\nreasoning, suggestion, transition, concealment, and\nfurther, sentence, clause, isolated words, interpretation and conclusion. Of these the first down to\nand including concealment are figures of thought,\nwhile the remainder are not figures at all. Rutilius\nalso in addition to the figures found in other\nauthors adds, of which I say the same.\nI will pass by those authors who set no limit to\ntheir craze for inventing technical terms and even\ninclude among figures what really comes under the\nhead of arguments. With regard to genuine figures, I would briefly\nadd that, while, suitably placed, they are a real\nornament to style, they become perfectly fatuous\nwhen sought after overmuch. There are some\nwho pay no consideration to the weight of their\nmatter or the force of their thoughts and think\nthemselves supreme artists, if only they succeed in\nforcing even the emptiest of words into figurative\nform, with the result that they are never tired of\nstringing figures together, despite the fact that it\nis as ridiculous to hunt for figures without reference\nto the matter as it is to discuss dress and gesture\nwithout reference to the body. But even perfectly\ncorrect figures must not be packed too closely together.\nChanges of facial expression and glances of the eyes\nare most effective in pleading, but if the orator never\nceases to distort his face with affected grimaces or to\nwag his head and roll his eyes, he becomes a laughing-stock. So too oratory possesses a natural mien,\nwhich while it is far from demanding a stolid and\nimmovable rigidity should as far as possible restrict\nitself to the expression with which it is endowed by\nnature. But it is of the first importance that we\nshould know what are the requirements of time,\nplace and character on each occasion of speaking.\nFor the majority of these figures aim at delighting the\nhearer. But when terror, hatred and pity are the weapons called for in the fray, who will endure the\norator who expresses his anger, his sorrow or his\nentreaties in neat antitheses, balanced cadences and\nexact correspondences Too much care for our words\nunder such circumstances weakens the impression of\nemotional sincerity, and wherever the orator displays\nhis art unveiled, the hearer says, IV. I should not venture to speak of artistic\nstructure after what Cicero has said upon the subject for there is I think no topic to which he has\ndevoted such elaborate discussion but for the fact\nthat his own contemporaries ventured to traverse his\ntheories on this subject even in letters which they\naddressed to him, while a number of later writers\nhave left on record numerous observations on the\nsame topic. Accordingly on a large number of\nquestions I shall be found in agreement with Cicero\nand shall deal more briefly with those points which\nadmit of no dispute, while there will be certain\nsubjects on which I shall express a certain amount\nof disagreement. For, though I intend to make my\nown views clear, I shall leave my readers free to\nhold their own opinion. I am well aware that there are certain writers\nwho would absolutely bar all study of artistic structure and contend that language as it chances to\npresent itself in the rough is more natural and even\nmore manly. If by this they mean that only that\nis natural which originated with nature and has\nnever received any subsequent cultivation, there is\nan end to the whole art of oratory. For the first\nmen did not speak with the care demanded by that\nart nor in accordance with the rules that it lays down. They knew nothing of introducing their\ncase by means of an exordium, of instructing the\njury by a statement of facts, of proving by argument\nor of arousing the emotions. They lacked all these\nqualifications as completely as they lacked all knowledge of the theory of artistic structure. But if\nthey were to be forbidden all progress in this\nrespect, they ought equally to have been forbidden\nto exchange their huts for houses, their cloaks of\nskin for civilised raiment and their mountains and\nforests for cities. What art was ever born fullgrown What does not ripen with cultivation\nWhy do we train the vine Why dig it We clear\nthe fields of brambles, and they too are natural products of the soil. We tame animals, and yet they\nare born wild. No, that which is most natural is\nthat which nature permits to be done to the greatest\nperfection. How can a style which lacks orderly\nstructure be stronger than one that is welded together\nand artistically arranged It must not be regarded\nas the fault of the study of structure that the employment of feet consisting of short syllables such as\ncharacterise the Sotadean and Galliambic metres\nand certain prose rhythms closely resembling them in\nwildness, weakens the force of our matter. Just as\nriver-currents are more violent when they run along a\nsloping bed, that presents no obstacles to check their\ncourse, than when their waters are broken and baffled\nby rocks that obstruct the channel, so a style which\nflows in a continuous stream with all the full development of its force is better than one which is rough\nand broken. Why then should it be thought that\npolish is inevitably prejudicial to vigour, when the\ntruth is that nothing can attain its full strength without the assistance of art, and that art is always\nproductive of beauty Is it not the fact that grace\nalways goes with the highest skill in throwing the\nspear, and that the truer the archer's aim, the more\ncomely is his attitude Again in fencing and all\nthe contests of the wrestling school, what one of all\nthe tricks of attack and defence is there, that does\nnot require movements and firmness of foot such as\ncan only be acquired by art Consequently in my\nopinion artistic structure gives force and direction\nto our thoughts just as the throwing-thong and the\nbowstring do to the spear and the arrow. And\nfor this reason all the best scholars are convinced\nthat the study of structure is of the utmost value,\nnot merely for charming the ear, but for stirring\nthe soul. For in the first place nothing can penetrate to the emotions that stumbles at the portals of\nthe ear, and secondly man is naturally attracted by\nharmonious sounds. Otherwise it would not be the\ncase that musical instruments, in spite of the fact\nthat their sounds are inarticulate, still succeed in\nexciting a variety of different emotions in the hearer.\nIn the sacred games different methods are employed\nto excite and calm the soul, different melodies are\nrequired for the war-song and the entreaty sung by\nthe suppliant on bended knee, while the war-note\nof the trumpet that leads the army forth to battle\nhas no resemblance to the call that sounds the\nretreat. It was the undoubted custom of the Pythagoreans, when they woke from slumber, to rouse\ntheir souls with the music of the lyre, that they\nmight be more alert for action, and before they\nretired to rest, to soothe their minds by melodies\nfrom the same instrument, in order that all restlessness of thought might be lulled to orderly repose.\nBut if there is such secret power in rhythm and\nmelody alone, this power is found at its strongest in\neloquence, and, however important the selection\nof words for the expression of our thoughts, the\nstructural art which welds them together in the\nbody of a period or rounds them off at the close,\nhas at least an equal claim to importance. For\nthere are some things which, despite triviality of\nthought and mediocrity of language, may achieve\ndistinction in virtue of this excellence alone. In\nfact, if we break up and disarrange any sentence\nthat may have struck us as vigorous, charming or\nelegant, we shall find that all its force, attraction\nand grace have disappeared. Cicero in his Orator\nbreaks up some of his own utterances in this way and so on. Disarrange\nthese periods in such a manner, and you will find\nthat the shafts you have hurled are broken or wide\nof the mark. Cicero also corrects passages in the\nspeeches of Gracchus where the structure appears to\nhim to be harsh. For Cicero this is becoming enough,\nbut we may content ourselves with testing our own\npower of welding together in artistic form the disconnected words and phrases which present themselves\nto us. For why should we seek elsewhere for\nexamples of faults which we may all of us find in\nour own work One point, however, it is enough\nsimply to noticethat the more beautiful in thought\nand language the sentence which you deprive of\nsuch structural cohesion, the more hideous will be the effect upon the style, for the very brilliance\nof the words at once exposes the carelessness of\ntheir arrangement. Accordingly, although I admit\nthat artistic structure, at any rate in perfection,\nwas the last accomplishment to be attained by\noratory, I still hold that even primitive orators\nregarded it as one of the objects of their study, as\nfar at least as the rudeness of their attainments\npermitted. For even Cicero for all his greatness\nwill never persuade me that Lysias, Herodotus and\nThucydides were careless in this respect. They\nmay not perhaps have pursued the same ideals as\nDemosthenes and Plato, and even these latter\ndiffered in their methods. For it would never have\ndone to spoil the fine and delicate texture of Lysias\nby the introduction of richer rhythms, since he\nwould thus have lost all that surpassing grace which\nhe derives from his simple and unaffected tone,\nwhile he would also have sacrificed the impression\nof sincerity which he now creates. For it must be\nremembered that he wrote his speeches for others\nto deliver, so that it was right that they should\nsuggest a lack of form and artistic structure indeed\nhis success in producing this effect actually shows his\nmastery of structure. Again history, which should\nmove with speed and impetuosity, would have been\nill-suited by the halts imposed by the rounding off\nof the period, by the pauses for breath inevitable\nin oratory, and the elaborate methods of opening\nsentences and bringing them to a close. It is however true that in the speeches inserted by historians\nwe may note something in the way of balanced\ncadences and antitheses. As regards Herodotus,\nwhile his flow, in my opinion, is always gentle, his dialect has such a sweetness of its own that it even\nseems to contain a certain rhythmical power hidden\nwithin itself. However I shall speak of the different\nideals a little later my immediate task is to teach\nthe student elementary rules which are essential if\ncorrectness of structure is to be attained. There are then in the first place two kinds of\nstyle the one is closely welded and woven together,\nwhile the other is of a looser texture such as is\nfound in dialogues and letters, except when they\ndeal with some subject above their natural level,\nsuch as philosophy, politics or the like. In saying\nthis, I do not mean to deny that even this looser\ntexture has its own peculiar rhythms which are perhaps the most difficult of all to analyse. For\ndialogues and letters do not demand continual\nhiatus between vowels or absence of rhythm, but on\nthe other hand they have not the flow or the compactness of other styles, nor does one word lead up\nso inexorably to another, the structural cohesion\nbeing loose rather than non-existent. Again in\nlegal cases of minor importance a similar simplicity\nwill be found to be most becoming, a simplicity,\nthat is to say, that does not dispense with rhythm\naltogether, but uses rhythms of a different kind,\nconceals them and employs a certain secrecy in their\nconstruction.\nBut the more closely welded style is composed of\nthree elements the comma, or as we call it incisum,\nthe colon, or in Latin menbrum, and the period,\nwhich Roman writers call ambitus, circumductum, continuatio or conclusio. Further, in all artistic structure\nthere are three necessary qualities, order, connexion\nand rhythm. Of these we will first discuss order, which must be\nconsidered in connexion with words taken both\nsingly and in conjunction. Words taken singly are\nknown as asyndeta unconnected. In dealing with\nthem we must take care that our style does not\ndiminish in force through the fact that a weaker\nword is made to follow a stronger as, for example,\nif after calling a man a despoiler of temples we were\nto speak of him as a thief, or after styling him a\nhighwayman were to dub him an insolent fellow.\nFor sentences should rise and grow in force of this\nan excellent example is provided by Cicero, where\nhe says, ; for there each phrase is\nfollowed by one stronger than the last, whereas, if\nhe had begun by referring to his whole body, he\ncould scarcely have gone on to speak of his lungs\nand throat without an anticlimax. There is also\nanother species of order which may be entitled\nnatural, as for example when we speak of in\npreference to the reverse order. In some cases a\nchange in the order will make a word superfluous\nfor example, we write fratres gemini rather than\ngemini fratres twin-brothers, since if gemini came\nfirst, there would be no necessity to add fratres. The\nrule which some have sought to enforce that nouns\nshould precede verbs, and verbs adverbs, while\nepithets and pronouns should follow their substantives, is a mere extravagance, since the reverse\norder is often adopted with excellent effect. Another\npiece of extravagant pedantry is to insist that the\nfirst place should always be occupied by what is first in order of time such an order is no doubt often the\nbest, but merely because previous events are often the\nmost important and should consequently be placed\nbefore matters of more trivial import. If the demands\nof artistic structure permit, it is far best to end the\nsentence with a verb for it is in verbs that the\nreal strength of language resides. But if it results\nin harshness of sound, this principle must give way\nbefore the demands of rhythm, as is frequently the\ncase in the best authors of Rome and Greece. Of\ncourse, in every case where a verb does not end the\nsentence, we shall have an hyperbaton, but hyperbaton\nis an admitted trope or figure, and therefore is to be\nregarded as an adornment. For words are not cut\nto suit metrical feet, and are therefore transferred\nfrom place to place to form the most suitable combinations, just as in the case of unhewn stones their\nvery irregularity is the means of suggesting what\nother stones they will best fit and what will supply\nthem with the surest resting-place. On the other\nhand, the happiest effects of language are produced\nwhen it is found possible to employ the natural\norder, apt connexion and appropriate rhythm. Some\ntranspositions are too long, as I have pointed out in\nprevious books, while at times they involve faulty\nstructure, although some writers actually aim at this\nvicious type of transposition, in order to create an\nappearance of freedom and license, as in the following phrases from Maecenas, sole et aurora rubent\nplurima; inter se sacra movit aqua fraxinos; ne exequias\nquidem unus inter miserrimos viderem meas. The worst\nfeature in these examples, is that he plays pranks with his structure while dealing with a sad theme.\nIt is, however, not infrequently possible to give\nspecial significance to a word by placing it at the\nclose of the sentence and thereby stamping and\nimpressing it on the mind of the hearer, whereas if\nit were placed in the middle of the sentence, it\nwould remain unnoticed, escape the attention and be\nobscured by its surroundings; the following passage\nfrom Cicero will illustrate what I mean ut tibi\nnecesse esset in conspectu populi Romani vomere postridie. Transfer the last word to some other position\nand the effect will be decreased. For the whole\npassage is made to converge to a point at the end;\nthe disgraceful circumstance of his being forced to\nvomit has been mentioned and the audience expect\nnothing more, when the orator adds yet a further\nrevolting feature of the case, namely that he was\nstill unable to retain his food the day after the\ncarouse. Domitius Afer was in the habit of transferring words at the cadence of the sentence solely\nfor the purpose of harshening his rhythm, more\nespecially in his exordia, as, for example, in his\ndefence of Cloatilla, where he says gratias again\ncontinuo, and in his defence of Laelia, where he\nsays, eis utrisque apud te iudicem periclitatur Laelia.\nTo such an extent did he avoid the voluptuous\neffect of soft and delicate rhythm, that he actually\ninterposed obstacles to break the natural harmonies\nof his language. There is a further drawback resulting from the faulty arrangement of words, with\nwhich we are all familiar, namely, that it leads to\nambiguity. The above remarks will, I think, suffice\nas a brief summary of the points which require\nnotice in connexion with order. If the order is faulty, our language will be deservedly liable to the\ncharge of lacking artistic construction, however\ncompact and rhythmical it may be. The next point for consideration is connexion,\nthat is to say connexion between words, commata,\ncola and periods. For all these have merits and\ndefects which turn on the way in which they are\nlinked together. I will follow the natural order\nand will begin by pointing out that there are some\nblemishes so obvious that even the uneducated\nregard them as worthy of censure; I refer to occasions when two consecutive words form some\nunseemly expression by the coalescence of the\nlast syllable of the first word and the first of the\nsecond. Again, there are occasions when vowels\nclash. When this happens, the language is broken\nby gaps and interstices and seems to labour. The\nmost unpleasing effects of sound will be produced\nby the juxtaposition of the same long vowels, while\nthe worst hiatus occurs between vowels which are\npronounced hollow- or open-mouthed. E has a\nflatter, i a narrower sound, and consequently such\nblemishes are less noticeable where they are concerned. It is a less serious fault to place short\nvowels after long, a statement which applies even\nmore strongly to placing short vowels before long.\nBut the least unsatisfactory combination is that of\ntwo short vowels. And in all conjunctions of vowels,\nthe resulting sound will be proportionately soft or\nharsh according as they resemble or differ from each\nother in the method of utterance. On the other\nhand, hiatus is not to be regarded as so very terrible\na crime in fact I do not know which is the worse\nfault in this connexion, carelessness or a pedantic solicitude for correctness. For anxiety on this score\nis bound to check the flow of our language and to\ndivert us from more important considerations.\nTherefore while it is a sign of carelessness to admit\nhiatus here, there and everywhere, it is a symptom\nof grovelling timidity to be continually in terror of\nit, and there is good reason for the view that all the\nfollowers of Isocrates and more especially Theopompus\npay accessive attention to the avoidance of this\ndetect. On the other hand Demosthenes and Cicero\nshow a sense of proportion in the way in which they\nface the problem. For the coalescence of two letters,\nknown as may make our language run\nmore smoothly than if every word closed with its\nown vowel, while sometimes hiatus may even prove\nbecoming and create an impression of grandeur, as\nin the following case, pulchra oratione ista iacta te.\nFor syllables which are naturally long and rich in\nsound gain something from the time which intervenes between two vowels, as though there were a\nperceptible pause. I cannot do better than quote\nthe words of Cicero on this subject. Hiatus, he\nsays, and the meeting of vowels produce a certain\nsoftness of effect, such as to suggest a not unpleasing\ncarelessness on the part of the orator, as though he were\nmore anxious about his matter than his words. But consonants also are liable to conflict at the\njuncture of words, more especially those letters\nwhich are comparatively harsh in sound; as for\ninstance when the final s of one word clashes with\nx at the opening of the next. Still more unpleasing\nis the hissing sound produced by the collision between\na pair of these consonants, as in the phrase ars\nstudiorum. This was the reason why Servius, as he himself has observed, dropped the final s, whenever\nthe next word began with a consonant, a practice\nfor which Luranius takes him to task, while Messala\ndefends him. For he thinks that Lucilius did not\npronounce the final s in phrases such as, Aeserninus\nfuit and dignus locoque, while Cicero in his Orator\nrecords that this was the practice with many of the\nancients. Hence we get forms such as belligerare and\npomeridiem, to which the diee hanc of Cato the Censor,\nwhere the final m is softened into an e, presents an\nanalogy. Unlearned readers are apt to alter such\nforms when they come across them in old books, and\nin their desire to decry the ignorance of the scribes\nconvict themselves of the same fault. On the other\nhand, whenever this same letter m comes at the end\nof a word and is brought into contact with the opening vowel of the next word in such a manner as to\nrender coalescence possible, it is, although written,\nso faintly pronounced e.g. in phrases such as nultum\nille and quantum erat that it may almost be regarded\nas producing the sound of a new letter. For it is not\nelided, but merely obscured, and may be considered\nas a symbol occurring between two vowels simply\nto prevent their coalescence. Care must also be\ntaken that the last syllables of one word are not\nidentical with the opening syllables of the next. In\ncase any of my readers should wonder that I think\nit worth while to lay down such a rule, I may point\nout that Cicero makes such a slip in his Letters, in the sentence res mihi invisae visae sunt, Brute, and\nin the following line of verse, Again it is a blemish to have too many monosyllables in succession, since the inevitable result is\nthat, owing to the frequency of the pauses, the\nrhythm degenerates into a series of jerks. For the\nsame reason we must avoid placing a number of\nshort verbs and nouns in succession; the converse\nalso is true as regards long syllables, since their\naccumulation makes our rhythm drag. It is a fault\nof the same class to end a number of successive\nsentences with similar cadences, terminations and\ninflexions. It is likewise inartistic to accumulate\nlong series of verbs, nouns or other parts of speech,\nsince even merits produce tedium unless they have\nthe saving grace of variety. The principles by which the connexion of words\nis guided are not sufficient in the case of commata and\ncola, though even here beginnings and ends should\nharmonise; but our structural effect will very largely\ndepend on the relative order of these two types of\nclause. For in the following instance vomens frustis\nesculentis gremium suum el totum tribunal implevit the\norder is satisfactory, since the fact of his having filled\nthe whole judgement seat with his vomiting is the\nmore important of the two. On the other hand\nfor I shall repeat the same illustrations for different\npurposes to make them more familiar in the following\npassage, saxa alque solitudines voci respondent, bestiae saepe immanes cantu flectuntur atque consistunt, the\ngradation would be improved, if it were reversed\nfor it is a greater miracle to move rocks than wild\nbeasts but the claims of structural grace have\ncarried the day. However, let us pass to the\nconsideration of rhythm. All combination, arrangement and connexion of\nwords involves either rhythms which we call numeri,\nor metres, that is, a certain measure. Now though\nboth rhythm and metre consist of feet, they differ in\nmore than one respect. For in the first place rhythm\nconsists of certain lengths of time, while metre is\ndetermined by the order in which these lengths are\narranged. Consequently the one seems to be concerned with quantity and the other with quality.\nRhythm may depend on equal balance, as in the case\nof dactylic rhythm, where one long syllable balances\ntwo short, there are it is true other feet of which\nthis statement is equally true, but the title of\ndactylic has been currently applied to all, while even\nboys are well aware that a long syllable is equivalent\nto two beats and a short to one or it may consist of\nfeet in which one portion is half as long again as the\nother, as is the case with paeanic rhythm a paean\nbeing composed of one long followed by three shorts,\nthree shorts followed by one long or with any other\narrangement preserving the proportion of three beats\nto two or finally one part of the foot may be twice\nthe length of the other, as in the case of the iambus,\nwhich is composed of a short followed by a long, or\nof the choreus consisting of a long followed by a\nshort. These feet are also employed by metre, but\nwith this difference, that in rhythm it does not matter\nwhether the two shorts of the dactyl precede or follow the long; for rhythm merely takes into\naccount the measurement of the time, that is to say,\nit insists on the time taken from its rise to its fall\nbeing the same. The measure of verse on the other\nhand is quite different; the anapaest u u _ or spondee\n_ _ cannot be substituted at will for the dactyl, nor\nis it a matter of indifference whether the paean\nbegins or ends with short syllables. Further, the\nlaws of metre not merely refuse the substitution of\none foot for another, but will not even admit the\narbitrary substitution of any dactyl or spondee for any\nother dactyl or spondee. For example, in the line the alteration of the order of the dactyls would\ndestroy the verse. There are also the following\ndifferences, that rhythm has unlimited space over\nwhich it may range, whereas the spaces of metre are\nconfined, and that, whereas metre has certain definite\ncadences, rhythm may run on as it commenced until\nit reaches the point of or transition to\nanother type of rhythm further, metre is concerned\nwith words alone, while rhythm extends also to the\nmotion of the body. Again rhythm more readily\nadmits of rests although they are found in metre as\nwell. Greater license is, however, admitted when\nthe time is measured by the beat of the feet or\nfingers, and the intervals are distinguished by\ncertain symbols indicating the number of shorts\ncontained within a given space hence we speak of\nfour or five time  or  and others\nlonger still, the Greek indicating a single beat. In prose the rhythm should be more definite and obvious to all. Consequently, it depends on feet,\nby which I mean metrical feet, which occur in\noratory to such an extent that we often let slip\nverses of every kind without being conscious of the\nfact, while everything written in prose can be shown\nby analysis to consist of short lines of verse of certain\nkinds or sections of the same. For example, I have\ncome across tiresome grammarians who attempted to\nforce prose into definite metres, as though it were a\nspecies of lyric poetry. Cicero, indeed, frequently\nasserts that the whole art of prose-structure consists\nin rhythm and is consequently censured by some\ncritics on the ground that he would fetter our\nstyle by the laws of rhythm. For these numeri,\nas he himself expressly asserts, are identical with\nrhythm, and he is followed in this by Virgil, who\nwrites, and Horace, who says, Among others they attack Cicero's statement that\nthe thunderbolts of Demosthenes would not have such\nforce but for the rhythm with which they are whirled and\nsped upon their way. If by rhythmis contorta he really\nmeans what his critics assert, I do not agree with\nhim. For rhythms have, as I have said, no fixed\nlimit or variety of structure, but run on with the same rise and fall till they reach their end, and the\nstyle of oratory will not stoop to be measured by\nthe beat of the foot or the fingers. This fact is\nclearly understood by Cicero, who frequently shows\nthat the sense in which he desires that prose should\nbe rhythmical is rather that it should not lack rhythm,\na deficiency which would stamp the author as a man\nof no taste or refinement, than that it should be tied\nby definite rhythmical laws, like poetry; just as,\nalthough we may not wish certain persons to be professional gymnasts, we still do not wish them to be\nabsolutely ignorant of the art of gynmastics. But the\nrounding of the period to an appropriate close which\nis produced by the combination of feet requires some\nname; and what name is there more suitable than\nrhythm, that is to say, the rhythm of oratory, just as\nthe enthymeme is the syllogism of oratory For my\nown part, to avoid incurring the calumny, from which\neven Cicero was not free, I ask my reader, whenever I\nspeak of the rhythm of artistic structure as I have\ndone on every occasion, to understand that I refer\nto the rhythm of oratory, not of verse. It is the task of collocation to link together the\nwords which have been selected, approved and handed\nover to its custody. For even harsh connexions are\nbetter than those which are absolutely valueless.\nNone the less I should allow the orator to select\ncertain words for their euphony, provided always that\ntheir force and meaning are the same as those of\nthe alternative words. He may also be permitted\nto add words, provided they are not superfluous, and\nto omit them, provided they are not essential to the\nsense, while he may employ figures to alter case and\nnumber, since such variety is attractive in itself, quite apart from the fact that it is frequently adopted\nfor the sake of the rhythm. Again if reason\ndemand one form and usage another, the claims of\nrhythm will decide our choice between the two,\ne.g. between vitavisse and vitasse or between deprehendere and deprendere. Further I do not object to\nthe coalescence of syllables or anything that does no\ninjury either to sense or style. The most important\ntask, however, is to know what word is best fitted to\nany given place. And the most accomplished artist\nwill be the man who does not arrange his words\nsolely with a view to rhythmic effect. On the other hand the management of feet is far\nmore difficult in prose than in verse, first because\nthere are but few feet in a single line of verse which\nis far shorter than the lengthy periods of prose;\nsecondly because each line of verse is always uniform\nand its movement is determined by a single definite\nscheme, whereas the structure of prose must be\nvaried if it is to avoid giving offence by its monotony\nand standing convicted of affectation. Rhythm\npervades the whole body of prose through all its\nextent. For we cannot speak without employing the\nlong and short syllables of which feet are composed.\nIts presence is, however, most necessary and most\napparent at the conclusion of the period, firstly\nbecause every group of connected thoughts has its\nnatural limit and demands a reasonable interval to\ndivide it from the commencement of what is to\nfollow secondly because the ear, after following the\nunbroken flow of the voice and being carried along\ndown the stream of oratory, finds its best opportunity\nof forming a sound judgement on what it has heard,\nwhen the rush of words comes to a halt and gives it time for consideration. Consequently all harshness\nand abruptness must be avoided at this point, where\nthe mind takes breath and recovers its energy. It\nis there that style has its citadel, it is this point that\nexcites the eager expectation of the audience, it is\nfrom this that the declaimer wins all his glory.\nNext to the conclusion of the period, it is the\nbeginning which claims the most care for the\naudience have their attention fixed on this as well.\nBut the opening of the sentence presents less difficulty, since it is independent and is not the slave of\nwhat has preceded. It merely takes what has preceded as a starting point, whereas the conclusion\ncoheres with what has preceded, and however carefully constructed, its elegance will be wasted, if the\npath which leads up to it be interrupted. Hence it\nis that although the rhythmical structure adopted by\nDemosthenes in the passage and again in another passage approved by\nall, I think, except Brutus is regarded as severely correct, Cicero is\ncriticised for passages such as familiaris coeperat esse\nbalneatori and for the not less unpleasing archipiratae.\nFor although balneatori and archipiratae give exactly\nthe same cadence as and the former are more severely correct. There is also\nsomething in the fact that in the passages from\nCicero two feet are contained in one word, a\npractice which even in verse produces an unduly\neffeminate effect, and that not merely when the line\nends with a five-syllable word as in fortissima\nTyndaridarum but also in four-syllable endings such as Appnnino, armamentis and Oreione. Consequently\nwe must also avoid ending our periods with words\ncontaining too many syllables.\nWith regard to the middle portions of our periods\nwe must take care not merely that they possess\ninternal cohesion, but also that the rhythm is neither\nsluggish nor long, and above all that we do not fall\ninto the now fashionable fault of placing a number\nof short syllables together with the result that we\nproduce an effect not unlike the sound of a child's\nrattle. For while the beginnings and conclusions of\nperiods, where the sense begins or ends, are the most\nimportant, it is none the less the fact that the middle\nportion may involve some special efforts which\nnecessitate slight pauses. Remember that the feet\nof a runner, even though they do not linger where\nthey fall, still leave a footprint. Consequently not\nonly must commata and cola begin and end becomingly, but even in parts which are absolutely\ncontinuous without a breathing space, there must be\nsuch almost imperceptible pauses. Who, for example,\ncan doubt that there is but one thought in the following passage and that it should be pronounced without\na halt for breath Animadverti, idlices, omnem accusatoris oralionem in duas divisan esse parties Still the\ngroups formed by the first two words, the next three,\nand then again by the next two and three, have each\ntheir own special rhythms and cause a slight check\nin our breathing at least such is the opinion of\nspecialists in rhythm. And just in proportion as\nthese small segments of the period are grave or\nvigorous, slow or rapid, languid or the reverse, so\nwill the periods which they go to form be severe or\nluxuriant, compact or loose. Again, the conclusions of clauses sometimes seem to halt or hang, if they\nare regarded apart from their context, but are usually\ncaught up and supported by what follows, so that\nwhat seemed a faulty cadence is corrected by the\ncontinuation. Non vult populus Romanus obsoletis\ncriminibus accusari Verrem would be harsh in rhythm,\nif the sentence ended there; but when it is continued\nwith what follows, nova postulat, inaudita desiderat,\nalthough the words are separate in meaning, the\nrhythmical effect is preserved. Ut adeas, tantum\ndabis would be a bad conclusion, for it forms the last\nportion of an iambic trimeter but it is followed by\nut cibum vestitumque introferre liceat, tantum the\nrhythm is still abrupt but is strengthened and supported by the last phrase of all, nemo recusabat. The appearance of a complete verse in prose has\na most uncouth effect, but even a portion of a verse\nis ugly, especially if the last half of a verse occurs in\nthe cadence of a period or the first half at the beginning. The reverse order may on the other hand\noften be positively pleasing, since at times the first\nhalf of a verse will make an excellent conclusion,\nprovided that it does not cover more than a few\nsyllables. This is especially the case with the\nsenarnis or octonarius. In Aliica fuisse is the opening of a senarius and closes the first clause of the pro\nLigario esse videatur, with which we are now only\ntoo familiar as a conclusion, is the beginning of an\nocionarius. Similar effects are to be found in Demosthenes, as for example and and throughout almost the whole exordium of that\nspeech. The ends of verses are also excellently\nsuited to the beginning of a period etsi vereor, iudices, for example and animadverti, iudices. But\nthe opening feet of a verse are not suited to the\nopening phrases of prose Livy provides an example\nof this in his preface, which begins with the first\nhalf of a hexameter, 'Facturusne operae premium sim'\nfor these are the words as he wrote them, and they\nare better so than as they have been corrected.\nAgain, the cadence of a verse is not suitable to the\ncadence of a period compare the phrase of Cicero,\nQuo me vertam, nescio, which is the end of a trimeter.\nIt matters not whether we speak of a trimeter or of\na senarius, since the line has six feet and three beats.\nThe end of a hexameter forms a yet worse conclusion;\ncompare the following passage from the letters of\nBrutus neque illi malunt halbere tutores aut defensores,\nquoniam causam sciunt placuiisse Catoni. Iambic endings\nare less noticeable, because that metre is near akin\nto prose. Consequently such lines often slip from\nus unawares they are specially common in Brutus\nas a result of his passion for severity of style; they\nare not infrequent in Asinius, and are sometimes\neven found in Cicero, as for example at the very\nbeginning of his speech against Lucius Piso Pro di\nimmortales, qui hic nunc illuxit dies Equal care must\nhowever be taken to avoid any phrase of a definitely\nmetrical character, such as the following passage\nfrom Sallust Falso queritur de natura sua.For\nalthough the language of prose is bound by certain\nlaws, it should appear to be free. None the less\nPlato, despite the care which he devotes to his\nrhythm, has not succeeded in avoiding this fault at the very opening of the Timaeus, where we are met\nat the very outset with the opening of a hexameter,\nwhich is followed by a colon which can be scanned as\nan Anacreontic, or if you like, as a trimeter, while it\nis also possible to form what the Greeks call a that is a portion of the hexameter\ncomposed of two feet and a part of a third and all\nthese instances occur within the space of three lines.\nAgain Thucydides has allowed to slip from his pen\na phrase of the most effeminate rhythm in But, having stated that all prose rhythm consists\nof feet, I must say something on these as well.\nDifferent names are given to these feet, and it is\nnecessary to determine what we shall call each of\nthem. For my part I propose to follow Cicero\nfor he himself followed the most eminent Greek\nauthorities, with this exception, that in my opinion\na foot is never more than three syllables long,\nwhereas Cicero includes the paean and the dochmiac\nu   u , of which the former has four and the\nlatter as many as five syllables. He does not, however, conceal the fact that some regard these as\nrhythms rather than feet and they are right in so\ndoing, since whatever is longer than three syllables\ninvolves more than one foot. Since then there are\nfour feet which consist of two syllables, and eight\ncomposed of three, I shall call them by the following\nnames two long syllables make a spondee; the\npyrrhic or pariambus, as some call it, is composed\nof two shorts; the iambus of a short followed by\na long; its opposite, that is a long followed by a\nshort, is a choreus, for I prefer that term to the\nname of trochee which is given it by others. Of trisyllabic feet the dactyl consists of a long followed\nby two shorts, while its opposite, which has the\nsame time-length, is called an anapaest. A short\nbetween two longs makes an amphimacer, although\nit is more often called a cretic, while a long between\ntwo shorts produces its opposite, the amphibruachys.\nTwo long syllables following a short make a bacchius,\nwhereas, if the long syllables come first the foot is\ncalled a palimbacchius. Three shorts make a trochee,\nalthough those who give that name to the choreus\ncall it a tribrach three longs make a molossus. Every\none of these feet is employed in prose, but those\nwhich take a greater time to utter and derive a\ncertain stability from the length of their syllables\nproduce a weightier style, short syllables being best\nadapted for a nimble and rapid style. Both types\nare useful in their proper place for weight and\nslowness are rightly condemned in passages where\nspeed is required, as are jerkiness and excessive\nspeed in passages which call for weight. It may\nalso be important to remark that there are degrees\nof length in long syllables and of shortness in short.\nConsequently, although syllables may be thought\nnever to involve more than two time-beats or less\nthan one, and although for that reason in metre all\nshorts and all longs are regarded as equal to other\nshorts and longs, they none the less possess some\nundefinable and secret quality, which makes some\nseem longer and others shorter than the normal.\nVerse, on the other hand, has its own peculiar\nfeatures, and consequently some syllables may be\neither long or short. Indeed, since strict law\nallows a vowel to be long or short, as the case may\nbe, when it stands alone, no less than when one or more consonants precede it, there can be no doubt,\nwhen it comes to the measuring of feet, that a short\nsyllable, followed by another which is either long\nor short, but is preceded by two consonants, is\nlengthened, as for example in the phrase agrestem\ntenui musam. For both a and gres are short, but\nthe latter lengthens the former, thereby transferring\nto it something of its own time-length. But how\ncan it do this, unless it possesses greater length\nthan is the portion of the shortest syllables, to\nwhich it would itself belong if the consonants st\nwere removed As it is, it lends one time-length\nto the preceding syllable, and subtracts one from\nthat which follows. Thus two syllables which are\nnaturally short have their time-value doubled by\nposition. I am, however, surprised that scholars of the\nhighest learning should have held the view that some\nfeet should be specially selected and others condemned for the purposes of prose, as if there were\nany foot which must not inevitably be found in\nprose. Ephorus may express a preference for the\npaean which was discovered by Thrasymachus and\napproved by Aristotle and for the dactyl also, on\nthe ground that both these feet provide a happy\nmixture of long and short; and may avoid the\nspondee and the trochee, condemning the one as too\nslow and the other as too rapid; Aristotle may\nregard the heroic foot, which is another name for\nthe dactyl, as too dignified and the iambus as too\ncommonplace, and may damn the trochee as too hasty and dub it the cancan; Theodectes and Theophrastus may agree with him, and a later critic,\nDionysius of Halicarnassus, may adopt a similar\nview; but for all they say, these feet will force\nthemselves upon them against their will, and it will\nnot always be possible for them to employ the dactyl\nor their beloved paean, which they select for special\npraise because it so rarely forms part of a verse rhythm. It is not, however, the words which cause\nsome feet to be of more common occurrence than\nothers; for the words cannot be increased or\ndiminished in bulk, nor yet can they, like the notes\nin music, be made short or long at will; everything\ndepends on transposition and arrangement. For a\nlarge proportion of feet are formed by the connexion\nor separation of words, which is the reason why\nseveral different verses can be made out of the same\nwords for example, I remember that a poet of no\nsmall distinction writing the following line a line which, if the order of the words be reversed,\nbecomes a Sotadean; again, the following Sotadean,\nif reversed, reads as as an iambic trimeter Feet therefore should be mixed, while care must be\ntaken that the majority are of a pleasing character,\nand that the inferior feet are lost in the surrounding\ncrowd of their superior kindred. The nature of\nletters and syllables cannot be changed, but their\nadaptability to each other is a consideration of no\nsmall importance. Long syllables, as I have said, carry the greater dignity and weight, while short\nsyllables create an impression of speed if the latter\nare intermixed with a few long syllables, their gait\nwill be a run, but a gallop if they are continuous.\nWhen a short syllable is followed by a long the effect\nis one of vigorous ascent, while a long followed by a\nshort produces a gentler impression and suggests\ndescent. It is therefore best to begin with long\nsyllables, though at times it may be correct to begin\nwith short, as in the phrase novum crimen a gentler\neffect is created, if we commence with two shorts,\nas in the phrase animadverti iudices but this opening, which comes from the pro Cluentio, is perfectly\ncorrect, since that speech begins with something\nsimilar to partition, which requires speed. Similarly\nthe conclusion of a sentence is stronger when long\nsyllables preponderate, but it may also be formed\nof short syllables, although the quantity of the final\nsyllable is regarded as indifferent. I am aware that\na concluding short syllable is usually regarded as\nequivalent to a long, because the time-length which\nit lacks appears to be supplied from that which\nfollows. But when I consult my own ears I find\nthat it makes a great difference whether the final\nsyllable is really long or only treated as the equivalent of a long. For there is not the same fullness\nof rhythm in diccre incipieniem timere as there is in\nausus est confiteri. But if it makes no difference\nwhether the final syllable be long or short, the concluding feet in these two instances must be identical\nand yet somehow or other one gives the impression\nof sitting down and the other of a simple halt.\nThis fact has led some critics to allow three timebeats for a final long syllable, adding the extra time-length which a short syllable derives from its\nposition at the end of a sentence to the long syllable\nas well. And it not merely makes a difference with\nwhat foot a sentence ends, but the penultimate\nfoot is also of importance. It is not, however,\nnecessary to go back further than three feet, and\nonly that if the feet contain less than three syllables,\nfor we must avoid the exactitude of verse on the\nother hand, we must not go back less than two\notherwise we shall be dealing with a foot and not\nwith rhythm. But in this connexion the dichoreus\nmay be regarded as one foot, if indeed a foot consisting of two chorei can be considered as a single foot.\nThe same is true of the paean composed of the\nchoreus and a pyrrhic, a foot which is regarded as\nspecially suitable to the beginning of a sentence, or\nof the other paean, formed of three shorts followed\nby a long, to which the conclusion is specially\ndedicated. It is of these two forms that writers on\nrhythm generally speak. Some, however, call all\nfeet containing three short syllables and a long by\nthe name of paean, irrespective of the position of\nthe long syllable, and merely taking into account the\ntotal number of time-lengths that it contains. The\ndochmiac, again, which consists of a bacchius and an\niambus, or of an iambus and a cretic, forms a solid and\nsevere conclusion. The spondee, so frequently employed in this position by Demosthenes, is used with\nvarying effect. It is most impressive when preceded\nby a cretic, as in the following instance De qua ego\nnihil dicam, nisi depellendi criminis causa. Again there\nis a point, of the importance of which I spoke above,\nnamely that it makes a considerable difference\nwhether two feet are contained in a single word or whether they are both detached. Thus criminis\ncausa makes a strong and archipiratae a weak ending, while tile weakness is still further increased if\nthe first foot be a tribrach, as for instance in words\nlike facilitates or temeritates. For the mere fact that\nwords are separated from each other involves an\nimperceptible length of time for instance, the\nspondee forming the middle foot of a pentameter must\nconsist of the last syllable of one word and the first\nof another, otherwise the verse is no verse at all.\nIt is permissible, though less satisfactory, for the\nspondee to be preceded by an anapaest e.g. muliere\nnon solum nobili, verum etiami nota. Andit may also, in\naddition to the anapaest and cretic, be preceded by\nthe iambus, which is a syllable less in length than\nboth of them, thus making one short syllable precede three long. But it is also perfectly correct to\nplace a spondee before an iambus, as in armis fui, or\nit may be preceded by a bacchius instead of a spondee,\ne.g. in armis fui, thereby making the last foot a\ndochmiac. From this it follows that the molossus also\nis adapted for use in the conclusion provided that it\nbe preceded by a short syllable, though it does not\nmatter to what foot the latter belongs e.g. illud\nscimus, ubicunque sunt, esse pro nobis. The effect of\nthe spondee is less weighty, if it be preceded by a\npalimbacchius and pyrrhic, as in iudicii Iuniani. Still\nworse is the rhythm when the spondee is preceded\nby a paean, as in Brute, dubitavi, although this\nphrase may, if we prefer, be regarded as consisting of a dactyl and a bacchius. As a rule, endings composed of two spondees, a termination which causes\ncomment even in a verse, are to be deprecated,\nunless the phrase is composed of three separate\nmembers, as in cur de perfiigis nostris copias comparat\nis contra nos where we have a word of two syllables\npreceded and followed by a monosyllable. Even the\ndactyl ought not to precede a final spondee, since we\ncondemn verse-endings at the period's close. The\nbacchius is employed at the conclusion, sometimes in\nconjunction with itself as in venenum timerss while it\nis also effective when a choreus and spondee are placed\nbefore it as in ut venenum timeres. Its opposite, the\npalimbacchius, is also employed as a conclusion unless, of course, we insist that the last syllable of a\nsentence is always long, and is best preceded by a\nmolossus, as in civis Romanus sum, or by a bacchius, as\nin quod hie potest, nos possemus. It would, however,\nbe truer to say that in such cases the conclusion consists of a choreus preceded by a spondee, for the rhythm\nis concentrated in nos possemus and Romanus sum. The\ndichoreus, which is the repetition of one and the same\nfoot, may also form the conclusion, and was much\nbeloved by the Asiatic school Cicero illustrates it by\nPatris dictum sapiens temeritasfilii comprobavit. The\nchoreus may also be preceded by a pyrrhic, as in omnes\nprope cives virtute, gloria, digitiate superabat. The\ndactyl also may come at the close, unless indeed it be\nheld that, when it forms the final foot, it is transformed\ninto a cretic e.g. muliercula nixus in litore. The\neffect will be good if it is preceded by a cretic or an\niambus, but unsatisfactory if it is preceded by a spondee, and worse still if by a choreus. The amphibrachys may close the cadence, as in Q. Ligarium in\nAfrica fuisse, although in that case some will prefer\nto call it a bacchius. The trochee is one of the less\ngood endings, if any final syllable is to be regarded\nas short, as it undoubtedly must be. Otherwise\nhow can we end with the dichoreus, so dear to many\norators Of course, if it be insisted that the final\nsyllable is long, the trochee becomes an anapaest. If\npreceded by a long syllable, the trochee becomes a\npaean, as is the case with phrases such as sipotero, or\ndirit hoc Cicero, or obstat invidia. But this form of\npaean is specially allotted to the beginnings of\nsentences. The pyrrhic may close a sentence if\npreceded by a choreus, thereby forming a paean.\nBut all these feet which end in short syllables will\nlack the stability required for the cadence, and\nshould as a rule only be employed in cases where\nspeed is required and there is no marked pause at\nthe ends of the sentences. The cretic is excellent,\nboth at the beginning e.g. quod precatus a diis immortalibus sum and at the close e.g. in conspeclu\npopuli Romani vomere postridie. The last example\nmakes it clear what a good effect is produced when\nit is preceded by an anapaest or by that form of paean\nwhich is regarded as best suited to the end of a\nsentence. But the cretic may be preceded by a\ncretic, as in servare quam plurinos. It is better thus\nthan when it is preceded by a chores, as in quis non\nturpe duceret assuming that we treat the final short\nsyllable as long. However, for the sake of argument,\nlet us substitute duceres for duceret. Here, however, we get the rest of which I spoke for we make a\nshort pause between the last word and the last\nbut one, thus slightly lengthening the final syllable\nof turpe; otherwise quis non turpe duceret will\ngive us a jerky rhythm resembling the end of\nan iambic trimeter. So, too, if you pronounce ore\nexcipere liceret without a pause, you will reproduce\nthe rhythm of a licentious metre, whereas if triply\npunctuated and thus provided with what are practically three separate beginnings, the phrase is full of\ndignity. In specifying the feet above-mentioned, I\ndo not mean to lay it down as an absolute law that\nno others can be used, but merely wish to indicate\nthe usual practice and the principles that are best\nsuited for present needs. I may add that two consecutive anapaests should be avoided, since they form\nthe conclusion of a pentameter or reproduce the rhythm\nof the anapaestic metre, as in the passage, nam ubi\nlibido dominatur, innocentiae leve praesidinun est, where\nelision makes the last two syllables sound as one.\nThe anapaest should preferably be preceded by a\nspondee or a bacchius, as, for instance, if you alter the\norder of words in the passage just quoted to leve\ninnocentiae praesidium est. Personally, although I\nknow that in this I am in disagreement with great\nwriters, I am not attracted by the paean consisting\nof three shorts followed by a long for it is no more\nthan an anapaest with the addition of another short\nsyllable e.g. facilitas, agilitas. Why it should have\nbeen so popular, I cannot see, unless it be that those\nwho gave it their approval were students of the\nlanguage of common life rather than of oratory.\nIt is preferably preceded by short syllables, such\nas are provided by the pyrrhic or the choreus e.g. mea facilitas, nostra facilitas; on the other hand, if\nit be preceded by a spondee, we have the conclusion\nof an iambic trimeter, as indeed we have in the paean\nconsidered alone. The opposite form of paean is\ndeservedly commended as an opening for the first\nsyllable gives it stability and the next three speed.\nNone the less I think that there are other feet\nwhich are better suited for this purpose than even\nthis paean. My purpose in discussing this topic at length is\nnot to lead the orator to enfeeble his style by\npedantic measurement of feet and weighing of\nsyllables for oratory should possess a vigorous\nflow, and such solicitude is worthy only of a\nwretched pedant, absorbed in trivial detail since\nthe man who exhausts himself by such painful diligence will have no time for more important considerations; for he will disregard the weight of his\nsubject matter, despise true beauty of style and, as\nLucilius says, will construct a tesselated pavement of\nphrases nicely dovetailed together in intricate patterns.\nThe inevitable result will be that his passions will\ncool and his energy be wasted, just as our dandies\ndestroy their horses' capacity for speed by training\nthem to shorten their paces. Prose-structure, of\ncourse, existed before rhythms were discovered in\nit, just as poetry was originally the outcome of a\nnatural impulse and was created by the instinctive\nfeeling of the ear for quantity and the observation of\ntime and rhythm, while the discovery of feet came\nlater. Consequently assiduous practice in writing will\nbe sufficient to enable us to produce similar rhythmical\neffects when speaking extempore. Further it is not so\nimportant for us to consider the actual feet as the general rhythmical effect of the period, just as the\npoet in writing a verse considers the metre as a\nwhole, and does not concentrate his attention on the\nsix or five individual feet that constitute the verse.\nFor poetry originated before the laws which govern\nit, a fact which explains Ennius' statement that\nFauns and prophets sang. Therefore rhythmical\nstructure will hold the same place in prose that is\nheld by versification in poetry. The best judge as to rhythm is the ear, which\nappreciates fullness of rhythm or feels the lack of it,\nis offended by harshness, soothed by smooth and\nexcited by impetuous movement, and approves\nstability, while it detects limping measures and\nrejects those that are excessive and extravagant.\nIt is for this reason that those who have received a\nthorough training understand the theory of artistic\nstructure, while even the untrained derive pleasure\nfrom it. There are some points, it is true, which are\nbeyond the power of art to inculcate. For example\nif the case, tense or mood with which we have\nbegun, produces a harsh rhythm, it must be changed.\nBut is it possible to lay down any definite rule as to\nwhat the change of case, tense or mood should be\nIt is often possible to help out the rhythm when it\nis in difficulties by introducing variety through the\nagency of a figure. But what is this figure to be\nA figure of speech or a figure of thought Can we\ngive any general ruling on the subject In such\ncases opportunism is our only salvation, and we must\nbe guided by consideration of the special circumstances. Further with regard to the time-lengths,\nwhich are of such importance where rhythm is concerned, what standard is there by which they can be regulated save that of the ear Why do some\nsentences produce a full rhythmical effect, although\nthe words which they contain are few, whereas others\ncontaining a greater number are abrupt and short in\nrhythm Why again in periods do we get an\nimpression of incompleteness, despite the fact that\nthe sense is complete Consider the following\nexample neminem vestrum ignorare arbitror, iudices,\nhunc per hosce dies sermonem vulgi atque hanc opinionem\npopuli Romani fiisse. Why is hosce preferable to hos,\nalthough the latter presents no harshness I am\nnot sure that I can give the reason, but none the\nless I feel that hosce is better. Why is it not enough\nto say sermonem vulgifuisse, which would have satisfied\nthe bare demands of rhythm I cannot tell, and yet\nmy ear tells me that the rhythm would have lacked\nfullness without the reduplication of the phrase. The\nanswer is that in such cases we must rely on feeling.\nIt is possible to have an inadequate understanding of\nwhat it is precisely that makes for severity or charm,\nbut yet to produce the required effect better by\ntaking nature for our guide in place of art none\nthe less there will always be some principle of art\nunderlying the promptings of nature. It is, however, the special duty of the orator to\nrealise when to employ the different kinds of\nrhythm. There are two points which call for\nconsideration if he is to do this with success. The\none is concerned with feet, the other with the\ngeneral rhythm of the period which is produced\nby their combination. I will deal with the latter\nfirst. We speak of commata, cola and periods.\nA comma, in my opinion, may be defined as the\nexpression of a thought lacking rhythmical completeness; on the other hand, most writers regard it\nmerely as a portion of the colon. As an example I\nmay cite the following from Cicero Domus tibi\ndeerat at habebas pecunia superabat at egebas.\nBut a comma may also consist of a single word, as in\nthe following instance where diximnus is a comma\nDiximus, testes dare volumus. A colon, on the other\nhand, is the expression of a thought which is\nrhythmically complete, but is meaningless if detached from the whole body of the sentence. For\nexample O callidos homines is complete in itself, but\nis useless if removed from the rest of the sentence,\nas the hand, foot or head if separated from the\nbody. He goes on, O rein excogitatam. At what\npoint do the members begin to form a body Only\nwhen the conclusion is added quem, quaeso, nostrum\nfefellit, id vos ita esse facturos a sentence which Cicero\nregards as unusually concise. Thus as a rule commata\nand cola are fragmentary and require a conclusion.\nThe period is given a number of different names by\nCicero, who calls it ambitus, circuitus, comprehensio,\ncontinuatio and circumscriptio. It has two forms. The\none is simple, and consists of one thought expressed\nin a number of words, duly rounded to a close. The\nother consists of commata and cola, comprising a\nnumber of different thoughts for example, aderat\nianitor carceris, carnriex praetoris and the rest. The\nperiod must have at least two cola. The average\nnumber would appear to be four, but it often contains\neven more. According to Cicero, its length should\nbe restricted to the equivalent of four senarii or to\nthe compass of a single breath. It is further essential\nthat it should complete the thought which it expresses. It must be clear and intelligible and must not be too long to be carried in the memory. A\ncolon, if too long, makes the sentence drag, while on\nthe other hand, if it be too short it gives an impression\nof instability. Wherever it is essential to speak with\nforce, energy and pugnacity, we shall make free use\nof commata and cola, since this is most effective, and\nour rhythmical structure must be so closely conformed to our matter, that violent themes should be\nexpressed in violent rhythms to enable the audience\nto share the horror felt by the speaker. On the\nother hand we shall employ cola by preference when\nnarrating facts, or relax the texture of our periods\nby considerable pauses and looser connexions, always\nexcepting those passages in which narration is\ndesigned for decorative effect and not merely for\nthe instruction of the audience, as for example the\npassage in the Verrines where Cicero tells the story\nof the Rape of Proserpine for in such cases a smooth\nand flowing texture is required. The full periodic\nstyle is well adapted to the exordium of important\ncases, where the theme requires the orator to express\nanxiety, admiration or pity the same is true of\ncommonplaces and all kinds of amplification. But it\nshould be severe when we are prosecuting and\nexpansive in panegyric. It is also most effective in\nthe peroration. But we must only employ this form\nof rhythmical structure in its full development, when\nthe judge has not merely got a grasp of the matter,\nbut has been charmed by our style, surrendered\nhimself to the pleader and is ready to be led whither\nwe will, by the delight which he experiences.\nHistory does not so much demand full, rounded\nrhythms as a certain continuity of motion and connexion of style. For all its cola are closely linked together, while the fluidity of its style gives it great\nvariety of movement; we may compare its motion\nto that of men, who link hands to steady their steps,\nand lend each other mutual support. The demonstrative type of oratory requires freer and more\nexpansive rhythms, while forensic and deliberative\noratory will vary the arrangement of their words in\nconformity with the variety of their themes.\nI must now turn to discuss the first of the two\npoints which I mentioned above. No one will deny\nthat some portions of our speech require a gentle\nflow of language, while others demand speed,\nsublimity, pugnacity, ornateness or simplicity, as\nthe case may be, or that long syllables are best\nadapted to express dignity, sublimity and ornateness.\nThat is to say, while the gentler form of utterance\nrequires length of vowel sounds, sublime and ornate\nlanguage demands sonority as well. On the other\nhand, passages of an opposite character, such as those\nin which we argue, distinguish, jest or use language\napproximating to colloquial speech, are better served\nby short syllables. Consequently in the exordium\nwe shall vary our structure to suit the thought.\nFor I cannot agree with Celsus, when he would\nimpose a single stereotyped form upon the exordium\nand asserts that the best example of the structure\nrequired for this purpose is to be found in Asinius\ne. g., si, Caesar, ex omnibus mortalibus, qui sunt ac\nfuerunt, posset huic causae disceptator legi, non quisquam\nte potius optandus nobis fuit. I do not for a moment\ndeny that the structure of this passage is excellent,\nbut I refuse to admit that the form of rhythmical\nstructure which it exemplifies should be forced on all\nexordia. For there are various ways in which the judge's mind may be prepared for what is to come\nat times we appeal for pity, at others take up a\nmodest attitude, while we may assume an air of\nenergy or dignity, flatter our audience, attempt to\nalter their opinions and exhort them to give us their\nbest attention, according as the situation may demand.\nAnd as all these methods are different by nature, so\neach requires a different rhythmical treatment. Did\nCicero employ similar rhythms in his exordia to the\npro Milone, the pro Cluentio and the pro Ligario\nThe statement of fact as a rule requires slower and\nwhat I may be allowed to call more modest feet;\nand the different kinds of feet should, as far as\npossible, be intermixed. For while the style of this\nportion of our speech is generally marked by restraint\nof language, there are occasions when it is called\nupon to soar to greater heights, although on the\nother hand its aim will at all times be to instruct the\naudience and impress the facts upon their minds, a\ntask which must not be carried out in a hurry. Indeed\nmy personal opinion is that the statement of fact\nshould be composed of long cola and short periods.\nArguments, inasmuch as they are characterised by\nenergy and speed, will employ the feet best adapted\nto these qualities. They will not however acquire\nrapidity at the expense of force by employing\ntrochees, but will rather make use of those feet which\nconsist of a mixture of long and short syllables,\nthough the long should not outnumber the short.\nLofty passages, which employ long and sonorous\nvowels, are specially well served by the amplitude of\nthe dactyl and the paean, feet which, although they\ncontain a majority of short syllables, are yet not\ndeficient in time-length. On the other hand, where violence is required, the requisite energy will be\nbest secured by the employment of the iambus, not\nmerely because that foot contains but two syllables,\nwith the result that its beat is more frequent, making\nit unsuited to gentle language, but also because every\nfoot gives the effect of an ascent, as they climb and\nswell from short to long, a fact which renders them\nsuperior to the choreus, which sinks from long to\nshort. Subdued passages, such as occur in the\nperoration, also require slow syllables, which must,\nhowever, be less sonorous. Celsus insists that there is a special form of rhythmical structure which produces a particularly stately\neffect I do not know to what he refers and, if I did,\nshould not teach it, since it must inevitably be slow\nand flat, that is to say unless this quality is derived\nfrom the words and thoughts expressed. If it is to\nbe sought for its own sake, independent of such\nconsiderations, I cannot sufficiently condemn it.\nBut, to bring this discussion to a close, I would\nremark that our rhythm must be designed to suit\nour delivery. Is not our tone subdued as a rule in\nthe exordium, except of course in cases of accusation\nwhere we have to rouse the judge or fill him with\nindignation, full and clear in the statement of fact,\nin argument impetuous and rapid not merely in our\nlanguage, but in our motions as well, expansive and\nfluent in commonplaces and descriptions and, as a rule,\nsubmissive and downcast in the peroration But the\nmotions of the body also have their own appropriate\nrhythms, while the musical theory of rhythm determines the value of metrical feet no less for dancing\nthan for tunes. Again, do we not adapt our voice\nand gesture to the nature of the themes on which we are speaking There is, therefore, all the less\nreason for wonder that the same is true of the feet\nemployed in prose, since it is natural that what is\nsublime should have a stately stride, that what is\ngentle should seem to be led along, that what\nis violent should seem to run and what is tender to\nflow. Consequently, where necessary, we must\nborrow the pompous effect produced by the spondees\nand iambi which compose the greater portion of the\nrhythms of tragedy, as in the line, But the comic senarius, styled trochaic, contains a\nnumber of pyrrhics and trochees, which others call\ntribrachs, but loses in dignity what it gains in speed,\nas for example in the line, Violent and abusive language, on the other hand,\neven in verse, as I have said, employs the iambic for\nits attack e.g., As a general rule, however, if the choice were forced\nupon me, I should prefer my rhythm to be harsh and\nviolent rather than nerveless and effeminate, as it is\nin so many writers, more especially in our own day,\nwhen it trips along in wanton measures that suggest\nthe accompaniment of castanets. Nor will any\nrhythm ever be so admirable that it ought to be continued with the same recurrence of feet. For we\nshall really be indulging in a species of versification\nif we seek to lay down one law for all varieties of\nspeech further, to do so would lay us open to the\ncharge of the most obvious affectation, a fault of\nwhich we should avoid even the smallest suspicion,\nwhile we should also weary and cloy our audience by\nthe resulting monotony; the sweeter the rhythm,\nthe sooner the orator who is detected in a studied\nadherence to its employment, will cease to carry\nconviction or to stir the passions and emotions. The\njudge will refuse to believe him or to allow him to\nexcite his compassion or his anger, if he thinks that\nhe has leisure for this species of refinement. It will\ntherefore be desirable from time to time that in\ncertain passages the rhythm should be deliberately\ndissolved this is a task of no small difficulty, if the\nappearance of effort is to be avoided. In so doing\nwe must not come to the assistance of the rhythm\nby introducing bhyperhata of extravagant length, for\nfear that we should betray the purpose of our action\nand we should certainly never in our search for\nsmoothness abandon for another any word that is\napt and appropriate to our theme. As a matter of\nfact no word will be so intractable as to baffle all our\nattempts to find it a suitable position; but it must\nbe remembered that when we avoid such words, we\ndo so not to enhance the charm of our rhythm, but\nto evade a difficulty. I am not, however, surprised\nthat Latin writers have paid more attention to\nrhythmical structure than the Athenians, since Latin\nwords possess less correctness and charm. Nor again\ndo I account it a fault in Cicero that, in this respect,\nhe diverged to some extent from the practice of Demosthenes. However, my final book will explain\nthe nature of the difference between our language\nand that of Greece. But I must bring this book to a conclusion without\nmore delay, since it has already exceeded the limits\ndesigned for it. To sum up then, artistic structure\nmust be decorous, pleasing and varied. It consists\nof three parts, order, connexion and rhythm. The\nmethod of its achievement lies in addition, subtraction\nand alteration of words. Its practice will depend\nupon the nature of our theme. The care which it\ndemands is great, but, still, less than that demanded\nby expression and thought. Above all it is necessary\nto conceal the care expended upon it so that our\nrhythms may seem to possess a spontaneous flow, not\nto have been the result of elaborate search or\ncompulsion. But these rules of style, while part of the\nstudent's theoretical knowledge, are not in themselves sufficient to give him oratorical power. In\naddition he will require that assured facility which\nthe Greeks call I know that many have raised\nthe question as to whether this is best acquired by\nwriting, reading or speaking, and it would indeed\nbe a question calling for serious consideration, if we\ncould rest content with any one of the three. But\nthey are so intimately and inseparably connected,\nthat if one of them be neglected, we shall but waste\nthe labour which we have devoted to the others.\nFor eloquence will never attain to its full development or robust health, unless it acquires strength\nby frequent practice in writing, while such practice\nwithout the models supplied by reading will be like\na ship drifting aimlessly without a steersman.\nAgain, he who knows what he ought to say and\nhow he should say it, will be like a miser brooding\nover his hoarded treasure, unless he has the weapons\nof his eloquence ready for battle and prepared to\ndeal with every emergency. But the degree in which a thing is essential does not necessarily make\nit of immediate and supreme importance for the\nformation of the ideal orator. For obviously the\npower of speech is the first essential, since therein\nlies the primary task of the orator, and it is obvious\nthat it was with this that the art of oratory began,\nand that the power of imitation comes next, and\nthird and last diligent practice in writing. But as\nperfection cannot be attained without starting at\nthe very beginning, the points which come first in\ntime will, as our training proceeds, become of quite\ntrivial importance. Now we have reached a stage in\nour enquiry where we are no longer considering the\npreliminary training of our orator; for I think the\ninstructions already given should suffice for that;\nthey are in any case as good as I could make them.\nOur present task is to consider how our athlete who\nhas learnt all the technique of his art from his\ntrainer, is to be prepared by actual practice for the\ncontests in which he will have to engage. Consequently, we must assume that our student has\nlearned how to conceive and dispose his subject\nmatter and understands how to choose and arrange\nhis words, and must proceed to instruct him how to\nmake the best and readiest use of the knowledge\nwhich he has acquired. There can then be no doubt that he must accumulate a certain store of resources, to be employed\nwhenever they may be required. The resources of\nwhich I speak consist in a copious supply of words\nand matter. But while the matter is necessarily\neither peculiar to the individual case, or at best\ncommon to only a few, words must be acquired to\nsuit all and every case. Now, if there were special words adapted to each individual thing, they would\nrequire less care, since they would automatically be\nsuggested by the matter in hand. But since some\nwords are more literal, more ornate, more significant\nor euphonious than others, our orator must not\nmerely be acquainted with all of them, but must\nhave them at his fingers' ends and before his very\neyes, so that when they present themselves for his\ncritical selection, he will find it easy to make the\nappropriate choice. I know that some speakers\nmake a practice of learning lists of synonyms by\nheart, in order that one word out of the several\navailable may at once present itself to them, and\nthat if, after using one word, they find that it is\nwanted again after a brief interval, they may be\nable to select another word with the same meaning\nand so avoid the necessity of repetition. But this\npractice is childish and involves thankless labour,\nwhile it is really of very little use, as it merely\nresults in the assembly of a disorderly crowd of\nwords, for the speaker to snatch the first that comes\nto hand. On the contrary, discrimination is necessary in\nthe acquisition of our stock of words; for we are\naiming at true oratory, not at the fluency of a\ncheapjack. And we shall attain our aim by reading\nand listening to the best writers and orators, since\nwe shall thus learn not merely the words by which\nthings are to be called, but when each particular\nword is most appropriate. For there is a place in\noratory for almost every word, with the exception\nonly of a very few, which are not sufficiently seemly.\nSuch words are indeed often praised when they\noccur in writers of iambics or of the old comedy, but we need do no more than consider our own\nspecial task. All words, with these exceptions,\nmay be admirably employed in some place or\nother. For sometimes we shall even require low\nand common words, while those which would\nseem coarse if introduced in the more elegant\nportions of our speech may, under certain circumstances, be appropriate enough. Now to acquire a\nknowledge of these words and to be acquainted not\nmerely with their meaning, but with their forms and\nrhythmical values, so that they may seem appropriate\nwherever employed, we shall need to read and listen\ndiligently, since all language is received first through\nthe ear. It was owing to this fact that the children\nwho, by order of a king, were brought up by a dumb\nnurse in a desert place, although they are said to\nhave uttered certain words, lacked the power of\nspeech. There are, however, some words of such\na nature that they express the same sense by\ndifferent sounds, so that it makes no difference to\nthe meaning which we use, as, for instance, gladius\nand ensis, which may be used indifferently when we\nhave to speak of a sword. Others, again, although\nproperly applied to specific objects, are used by\nmeans of a trope to express the same sense, as, for\nexample, ferrum steel and muro point, which are\nboth used in the sense of sword. Thus, by the\nfigure known as abuse, we call all those who commit\na murder with any weapon whatsoever sicarii poniarders. In other cases we express our meaning\nperiphrastically, as, for instance, when Virgil\ndescribes cheese as On the other hand, in a number of instances we\nemploy figures and substitute one expression for\nanother. Instead of we say or or or or But we may also\nborrow from a word of cognate meaning. For or or are often\nequivalent to Reading will provide us\nwith a rich store of expressions such as these,\nand will enable us not merely to use them when\nthey occur to us, but also in the appropriate manner.\nFor they are not always interchangeable for\nexample, though I may be perfectly correct in\nsaying, for it does not\nfollow that I can say for and though mucro may be employed to\ndescribe a sword, a sword does not necessarily mean\nthe same as mucro point. But, although a store\nof words may be acquired by these means, we must\nnot read or listen to orators merely for the sake of\nacquiring words. For in everything which we teach\nexamples are more effective even than the rules\nwhich are taught in the schools, so long as the\nstudent has reached a stage when he can appreciate\nsuch examples without the assistance of a teacher,\nand can rely on his own powers to imitate them.\nAnd the reason is this, that the professor of rhetoric\nlays down rules, while the orator gives a practical\ndemonstration. But the advantages conferred by reading and\nlistening are not identical. The speaker stimulates\nus by the animation of his delivery, and kindles the\nimagination, not by presenting us with an elaborate picture, but by bringing us into actual touch with\nthe things themselves. Then all is life and movement, and we receive the new-born offspring of his\nimagination with enthusiastic approval. We are\nmoved not merely by the actual issue of the trial,\nbut by all that the orator himself has at stake. Moreover his voice, the grace of his gestures, the adaptation of his delivery which is of supreme importance\nin oratory, and, in a word, all his excellences in\ncombination, have their educative effect. In reading,\non the other hand, the critical faculty is a surer\nguide, inasmuch as the listener's judgment is often\nswept away by his preference for a particular speaker,\nor by the applause of an enthusiastic audience. For\nwe are ashamed to disagree with them, and an unconscious modesty prevents us from ranking our own\nopinion above theirs, though all the time the taste\nof the majority is vicious, and the claque may\npraise even what does not really deserve approval.\nOn the other hand, it will sometimes also happen\nthat an audience whose taste is bad will fail to award\nthe praise which is due to the most admirable utterances. Reading, however, is free, and does not hurry\npast us with the speed of oral delivery; we can reread a passage again and again if we are in doubt\nabout it or wish to fix it in the memory. We must\nreturn to what we have read and reconsider it with\ncare, while, just as we do not swallow our food till\nwe have chewed it and reduced it almost to a state\nof liquefaction to assist the process of digestion, so\nwhat we read must not be committed to the memory\nfor subsequent imitation while it is still in a crude\nstate, but must be softened and, if I may use the\nphrase, reduced to a pulp by frequent re-perusal. For a long time also we should read none save the\nbest authors and such as are least likely to betray our\ntrust in then, while our reading must be almost as\nthorough as if we were actually transcribing what we\nread. Nor must we study it merely in parts, but\nmust read through the whole work from cover to\ncover and then read it afresh, a precept which applies\nmore especially to speeches, whose merits are often\ndeliberately disguised. For the orator frequently\nprepares his audience for what is to come, dissembles\nand sets a trap for them and makes remarks at the\nopening of his speech which will not have their full\nforce till the conclusion. Consequently what he\nsays will often seem comparatively ineffective where\nit actually occurs, since we do not realise his motive\nand it will be necessary to re-read the speech after\nwe have acquainted ourselves with all that it contains. Above all, it is most desirable that we should\nfamiliarise ourselves with the facts of the case with\nwhich the speech deals, and it will be well also,\nwherever possible, to read the speeches delivered on\nboth sides, such as those of Aeschines and Demosthenes in the case of Ctesiphon, of Servius Sulpicius\nand Messala for and against Aufidia, of Pollio and\nCassius in the case of Asprenas, and many others.\nAnd even if such speeches seem unequal in point of\nmerit, we shall still do well to study them carefully\nwith a view to understanding the problems raised by\nthe cases with which they deal for example, we\nshould compare the speeches delivered by Tubero\nagainst Ligarius and by Hortensius in defence of\nVerres with those of Cicero for the opposite side,\nwhile it will also be useful to know how different\norators pleaded the same case. For example, Calidius spoke on the subject of Cicero's house,\nBrutus wrote a declamation in defence of Milo, which\nCornelius Celsus wrongly believes to have been\nactually delivered in court, and Pollio and Messalla\ndefended the same clients, while in my boyhood\nremarkable speeches delivered by Domitius Afer,\nCrispus Passienus and Decimis Laelius in defence of Volusenus were in circulation. The reader must not, however, jump to the conclusion that all that was uttered by the best authors is\nnecessarily perfect. At times they lapse and stagger\nbeneath the weight of their task, indulge their bent\nor relax their efforts. Sometimes, again, they give\nthe impression of weariness for example, Cicero\nthinks that Demosthenes sometimes nods, and Horace\nsays the same of Homer himself. For despite their\ngreatness they are still but mortal men, and it will\nsometimes happen that their reader assumes that\nanything which he finds in them may be taken as a\ncanon of style, with the result that he imitates their\ndefects and it is always easier to do this than to\nimitate their excellences and thinks himself a\nperfect replica if he succeeds in copying the\nblemishes of great men. But modesty and circumspection are required in pronouncing judgment on\nsuch great men, since there is always the risk of\nfalling into the common fault of condemning what\none does not understand. And, if it is necessary to\nerr on one side or the other, I should prefer that\nthe reader should approve of everything than that\nhe should disapprove of much. Theophrastus says that the reading of poets is\nof great service to the orator, and has rightly been\nfollowed in this view by many. For the poets will give us inspiration as regards the matter, sublimity\nof language, the power to excite every kind of\nemotion, and the appropriate treatment of character,\nwhile minds that have become jaded owing to the\ndaily wear and tear of the courts will find refreshment in such agreeable study. Consequently Cicero\nrecommends the relaxation provided by the reading\nof poetry. We should, however, remember that the\norator must not follow the poets in everything, more\nespecially in their freedom of language and their\nlicense in the use of figures. Poetry has been compared to the oratory of display, and further aims\nsolely at giving pleasure, which it seeks to secure by\ninventing what is not merely untrue, but sometimes\neven incredible. Further, we must bear in mind\nthat it can be defended on the ground that it is tied\nby certain metrical necessities and consequently cannot always use straightforward and literal language,\nbut is driven from the direct road to take refuge in\ncertain by-ways of expression; and compelled not\nmerely to change certain words, but to lengthen,\ncontract, transpose or divide them, whereas the\norator stands armed in the forefront of the battle,\nfights for a high stake and devotes all his effort to\nwinning the victory. And yet I would not have his\nweapons defaced by mould and rust, but would have\nthem shine with a splendour that shall strike terror\nto the heart of the foe, like the flashing steel that\ndazzles heart and eye at once, not like the gleam of\ngold or silver, which has no warlike efficacy and is\neven a positive peril to its wearer. History, also, may provide the orator with a nutriment which we may compare to some rich and\npleasant juice. But when we read it, we must remember that many of the excellences of the historian\nrequire to be shunned by the orator. For history\nhas a certain affinity to poetry and may be regarded\nas a kind of prose poem, while it is written for the\npurpose of narrative, not of proof, and designed from\nbeginning to end not for immediate effect or the\ninstant necessities of forensic strife, but to record\nevents for the benefit of posterity and to win glory\nfor its author. Consequently, to avoid monotony of\nnarrative, it employs unusual words and indulges in\na freer use of figures. Therefore, as I have already\nsaid, the famous brevity of Sallust, than which\nnothing can be more pleasing to the leisured ear of\nthe scholar, is a style to be avoided by the orator in\nview of the fact that his words are addressed to a\njudge who has his mind occupied by a number of\nthoughts and is also frequently uneducated, while,\non the other hand, the milky fullness of Livy is\nhardly of a kind to instruct a listener who looks not\nfor beauty of exposition, but for truth and credibility.\nWe must also remember that Cicero thinks that not\neven 'Thucydidcs or Xenophon will be of much service to an orator, although he regards the style of\nthe former as a veritable call to arms and considers\nthat the latter was the mouthpiece of the Muses.\nIt is, however, occasionally permissible to borrow the\ngraces of history to embellish our digressions, provided always that we remember that in those portions\nof our speech which deal with the actual question\nat issue we require not the swelling thews of the\nathlete, but the wiry sinews of the soldier, and that\nthe cloak of many colours which Demetrius of\nPhalerum was said to wear is but little suited to\nthe dust and heat of the forum. There is, it is true, another advantage which we may derive from the\nhistorians, which, however, despite its great importance, has no bearing on our present topic; I refer to\nthe advantage derived from the knowledge of historical facts and precedents, with which it is most desirable that our orator should be acquainted; for such\nknowledge will save him from having to acquire all\nhis evidence from his client and will enable him to\ndraw much that is germane to his case from the\ncareful study of antiquity. And such arguments will\nbe all the more effective, since they alone will be\nabove suspicion of prejudice or partiality. The fact that there is so much for which we must\nhave recourse to the study of the philosophers is\nthe fault of orators who have abandoned to them\nthe fullest portion of their own task. The Stoics\nmore especially discourse and argue with great\nkeenness on what is just, honourable, expedient\nand the reverse, as well as on the problems of\ntheology, while the Socratics give the future orator\na first-rate preparation for forensic debates and\nthe examination of witnesses. But we must use the\nsame critical caution in studying the philosophers\nthat we require in reading history or poetry; that\nis to say, we must bear in mind that, even when we\nare dealing with the same subjects, there is a wide\ndifference between forensic disputes and philosophical\ndiscussions, between the law-courts and the lecture-room, between the precepts of theory and the perils\nof the bar. Most of my readers will, I think, demand that,\nsince I attach so much importance to reading, I\nshould include in this work some instructions as to\nwhat authors should be read and what their special excellences may be. To do this in detail would be\nan endless task. Remember that Cicero in his\nBrutus, after writing pages and pages on the subject\nof Roman orators alone, says nothing of his own contemporaries with the exception of Caesar and Marcellus. What limit, then, would there be to my\nlabours if I were to attempt to deal with them and\nwith their successors and all the orators of Greece as\nwell No, it was a safer course that Livy adopted\nin his letter to his son, where he writes that he should\nread Cicero and Demosthenes and then such orators\nas most resembled them. Still, I must not conceal\nmy own personal convictions on this subject. I believe\nthat there are few, indeed scarcely a single one of\nthose authors who have stood the test of time who will\nnot be of some use or other to judicious students, since\neven Cicero himself admits that he owes a great debt\neven to the earliest writers, who for all their talent\nwere totally devoid of art. And my opinion about\nthe moderns is much the same. For how few of them\nare so utterly crazy as not to have the least shadow\nof hope that some portion or other of their work may\nhave claims upon the memory of posterity If there\nis such an one, he will be detected before we have\nperused many lines of his writings, and we shall\nescape from him before the experiment of reading\nhim has cost us any serious loss of time. On the\nother hand, not everything that has some bearing on\nsome department of knowledge will necessarily be of\nservice for the formation of style, with which we are\nfor the moment concerned. Before, however, I begin to speak of individual\nauthors, I must make a few general remarks about\nthe variety of judgments which have been passed upon them. For there are some who think that only\nthe ancients should be read and hold that they are\nthe sole possessors of natural eloquence and manly\nvigour; while others revel in the voluptuous and\naffected style of to-day, in which everything is designed to charm the ears of the uneducated majority.\nAnd even if we turn to those who desire to follow\nthe correct methods of style, we shall find that some\nthink that the only healthy and genuinely Attic style\nis to be found in language which is restrained and\nsimple and as little removed as possible from the\nspeech of every day, while others are attracted by a\nstyle which is more elevated and full of energy and\nanimation. There are, too, not a few who are devoted to a gentle, elegant and harmonious style. Of\nthese different ideals I shall speak in greater detail,\nwhen I come to discuss the question of the particular\nstyles best suited to oratory. For the moment I\nshall restrict myself to touching briefly on what the\nstudent who desires to consolidate his powers of\nspeaking should seek in his reading and to what kind\nof reading he should devote his attention. My design is merely to select a few of the most eminent\nauthors for consideration. It will be easy for the\nstudent to decide for himself what authors most\nnearly resemble these consequently, no one will\nhave any right to complain if I pass over some of his\nfavourites. For I will readily admit that there are\nmore authors worth reading than those whom I propose to mention. But I will now proceed to deal\nwith the various classes of reading which I consider\nmost suitable for those who are ambitious of becoming\norators. I shall, I think, be right in following the principle laid down by Aratus in the line, and in beginning with Homer. He is like\nhis own conception of Ocean, which he describes as\nthe source of every stream and river; for he has\ngiven us a model and an inspiration for every\ndepartment of eloquence. It will be generally admitted that no one has ever surpassed him in the\nsublimity with which he invests great themes or the\npropriety with which he handles small. He is at\nonce luxuriant and concise, sprightly and serious,\nremarkable at once for his fullness and his brevity,\nand supreme not merely for poetic, but for oratorical\npower as well. For, to say nothing of his eloquence,\nwhich he shows in praise, exhortation and consolation, do not the ninth book containing the embassy\nto Achilles, the first describing the quarrel between\nthe chiefs, or the speeches delivered by the counsellors in the second, display all the rules of art\nto be followed in forensic or deliberative oratory\nAs regards the emotions, there can be no one so illeducated as to deny that the poet was the master of all,\ntender and vehement alike. Again, in the few lines\nwith which he introduces both of his epics, has he\nnot, I will not say observed, but actually established\nthe law which should govern the composition of the\nexordium For, by his invocation of the goddesses\nbelieved to preside over poetry he wins the goodwill\nof his audience, by his statement of the greatness\nof his themes he excites their attention and renders\nthem receptive by the briefness of his summary.\nWho can narrate more briefly than the hero who\nbrings the news of Patroclus' death, or more vividly\nthan he who describes the battle between the\nCuretes and the Aetolians Then consider his similes, his amplifications, his illustrations, digressions, indications of fact, inferences, and all the\nother methods of proof and refutation which he\nemploys. They are so numerous that the majority\nof writers on the principles of rhetoric have gone to\nhis works for examples of all these things. And as\nfor perorations, what can ever be equal to the prayers\nwhich Priam addresses to Achilles when he comes\nto beg for the body of his son Again, does he not\ntranscend the limits of human genius in his choice\nof words, his reflexions, figures, and the arrangement\nof his whole work, with the result that it requires a\npowerful mind, I will not say to imitate, for that is\nimpossible, but even to appreciate his excellences\nBut he has in truth outdistanced all that have come\nafter him in every department of eloquence, above\nall, he has outstripped all other writers of epic, the\ncontrast in their case being especially striking owing\nto the similarity of the material with which they\ndeal. Hesiod rarely rises to any height, while a\ngreat part of his works is filled almost entirely with\nnames none the less, his maxims of moral wisdom\nprovide a useful model, the smooth flow of his\nwords and structure merit our approval, and he\nis assigned the first place among writers of the\nintermediate style. On the other hand, Antimachus\ndeserves praise for the vigour, dignity and elevation of his language. But although practically all\nteachers of literature rank him second among epic\npoets, he is deficient in emotional power, charm, and\narrangement of matter, and totally devoid of real\nart. No better example can be found to show what\na vast difference there is to being near another\nwriter and being second to him. Panyasis is regarded as combining the qualities of the last two\npoets, being their inferior in point of style, but\nsurpassing Hesiod in the choice of his subject and\nAntimachus in its arrangement. Apollonius is not\nadmitted to the lists drawn up by the professors\nof literature, because the critics, Aristarchus and\nAristophanes, included no contemporary poets.\nNone the less, his work is by no means to be\ndespised, being distinguished by the consistency\nwith which he maintains his level as a representative of the intermediate type. The subject\nchosen by Aratus is lifeless and monotonous, affording no scope for pathos, description of character,\nor eloquent speeches. However, he is adequate for\nthe task to which he felt himself equal. Theocritus\nis admirable in his own way, but the rustic and\npastoral muse shrinks not merely from the forum,\nbut from town-life of every kind. I think I hear\nmy readers on all sides suggesting the names of\nhosts of other poets. What Did not Pisandros\ntell the story of Hercules in admirable style\nWere there not good reasons for Virgil and Macer\ntaking Nicander as a model Are we to ignore\nEuphorion Unless Virgil had admired him, he\nwould never have mentioned in the Eclogues. Again, had Horace no justification\nfor coupling the name of Tyrtacus with that of\nHomer To which I reply, that there is no one so\nignorant of poetic literature that he could not, if he\nchose, copy a catalogue of such poets from some library for insertion in his own treatises. I can\ntherefore assure my readers that I am well aware\nof the existence of the poets whom I pass over in\nsilence, and am far from condemning them, since I\nhave already said that some profit may be derived\nfrom every author. But we must wait till our\npowers have been developed and established to the\nfull before we turn to these poets, just as at banquets\nwe take our fill of the best fare and then turn\nto other food which, in spite of its comparative\ninferiority, is still attractive owing to its variety.\nNot until our taste is formed shall we have leisure\nto study the elegiac poets as well. Of these, Callimachus is regarded as the best, the second place\nbeing, according to the verdict of most critics,\noccupied by Philetas. But until we have acquired\nthat assured facility of which I spoke, we must\nfamiliarise ourselves with the best writers only and\nmust form our minds and develop an appropriate tone\nby reading that is deep rather than wide. Consequently, of the three writers of iambics approved by\nthe judgment of Aristarchus, Archilochus will be far\nthe most useful for the formation of the facility in\nquestion. For he has a most forcible style, is full of\nvigorous, terse and pungent reflexions, and overflowing with life and energy indeed, some critics\nthink that it is due solely to the nature of his\nsubjects, and not to his genius, that any poets are to\nbe ranked above him. Of the nine lyric poets\nPindar is by far the greatest, in virtue of his inspired\nmagnificence, the beauty of his thoughts and figures,\nthe rich exuberance of his language and matter,\nand his rolling flood of eloquence, characteristics\nwhich, as Horace rightly held, make him inimitable. The greatness of the genius of Stesichorus\nis shown by his choice of subject for he sings of the\ngreatest wars and the most glorious of chieftains,\nand the music of his lyre is equal to the weighty\nthemes of epic poetry. For both in speech and\naction he invests his characters with the dignity\nwhich is their due, and if he had only been capable\nof exercising a little more restraint, he might,\nperhaps, have proved a serious rival to Homer.\nBut he is redundant and diffuse, a fault which,\nwhile deserving of censure, is nevertheless a defect\nspringing from the very fullness of his genius.\nAlcaeus has deserved the compliment of being said\nto make music with quill of gold in that portion\nof his works in which he attacks the tyrants of his\nday and shows himself a real moral force. He is,\nmoreover, terse and magnificent in style, while the\nvigour of his diction resembles that of oratory. But\nhe also wrote poetry of a more sportive nature and\nstooped to erotic poetry, despite his aptitude for\nloftier themes. Simonides wrote in a simple style,\nbut may be recommended for the propriety and\ncharm of his language. His chief merit, however,\nlies in his power to excite pity, so much so, in fact,\nthat some rank him in this respect above all writers\nof this class of poetry. The old comedy is almost the only form of poetry\nwhich preserves intact the true grace of Attic\ndiction, while it is characterized by the most eloquent freedom of speech, and shows especial power\nin the denunciation of vice; but it reveals great\nforce in other departments as well. For its style\nis at once lofty, elegant and graceful, and if we\nexcept Homer, who, like Achilles among warriors, is beyond all comparison, I am not sure that there\nis any style which bears a closer resemblance to\noratory or is better adapted for forming the orator.\nThere are a number of writers of the old comedy,\nbut the best are Aristophanes, Eupolis and Cratinus. Aeschylus was the first to bring tragedy into\nprominence he is lofty, dignified, grandiloquent\noften to a fault, but frequently uncouth and inharmonious. Consequently, the Athenians allowed\nlater poets to revise his tragedies and to produce\nthem in the dramatic contests, and many succeeded\nin winning the prize by such means. Sophocles\nand Euripides, however, brought tragedy to far\ngreater perfection they differ in style, but it is\nmuch disputed as to which should be awarded the\nsupremacy, a question which, as it has no bearing\non my present theme, I shall make no attempt to\ndecide. But this much is certain and incontrovertible, that Euripides will be found of far greater service\nto those who are training themselves for pleading in\ncourt. For his language, although actually censured\nby those who regard the dignity, the stately\nstride and sonorous utterance of Sophocles as being\nmore sublime, has a closer affinity to that of oratory,\nwhile he is full of striking reflexions, in which,\nindeed, in their special sphere, he rivals the\nphilosophers themselves, and for defence and attack may be compared with any orator that has\nwon renown in the courts. Finally, although admirable in every kind of emotional appeal, he is\neasily supreme in the power to excite pity.\nMenander, as he often testifies in his works, had\na profound admiration for Euripides, and imitated\nhim, although in a different type of work. Now, the careful study of Menander alone would, in my\nopinion, be sufficient to develop all those qualities\nwith the production of which my present work\nis concerned; so perfect is his representation of\nactual life, so rich is his power of invention and\nhis gift of style, so perfectly does he adapt himself\nto every kind of circumstance, character and emotion. Indeed, those critics are no fools who think\nthe speeches attributed to Charisius were in reality\nwritten by Menander. But I consider that he shows\nhis power as an orator far more clearly in his\ncomedies; since assuredly we can find no more\nperfect models of every oratorical quality than the\njudicial pleadings of his Epitrepontes, Epicleros\nand Locri, or the declamatory speeches in the Psophodes, Nomothetes. and Hypobolimaeus. Still, for\nmy own part, I think that he will be found even more\nuseful by declaimers, in view of the fact that they\nhave, according to the nature of the various controversial themes, to undertake a number of different\nroles and to impersonate fathers, sons, soldiers,\npeasants, rich men and poor, the angry man and\nthe suppliant, the gentle and the harsh. And all\nthese characters are treated by this poet with\nconsummate appropriateness. Indeed, such is his\nsupremacy that he has scarce left a name to other\nwriters of the new comedy, and has cast them into\ndarkness by the splendour of his own renown.\nStill, you will find something of value in the other\ncomic poets as well, if you read them in not too\ncritical a spirit; above all, profit may be derived\nfrom the study of Philemon, who, although it was a depraved taste which caused his contemporaries\noften to prefer him to Menander, has none the\nless deserved the second place which posterity has\nbeen unanimous in awarding him. If we turn to history, we shall find a number of\ndistinguished writers; but there are two who must\nundoubtedly be set far above all their rivals their\nexcellences are different in kind, but have won\nalmost equal praise. Thucydides is compact in\ntexture, terse and ever eager to press forward Herodotus is pleasant, lucid and diffuse the former\nexcels in vigour, speeches and the expression of the\nstronger passions; the latter in charm, conversations\nand the delineation of the gentler emotions. Theopompus comes next, and though as a historian he\nis inferior to the authors just mentioned, his style\nhas a greater resemblance to oratory, which is not\nsurprising, as he was an orator before he was urged\nto turn to history. Philistus also deserves special\ndistinction among the crowd of later historians, good\nthough they may have been he was an imitator of\nThucydides, and though far his inferior, was somewhat more lucid. Ephorus, according to Isocrates,\nneeded the spur. Clitarchus has won approval by\nhis talent, but his accuracy has been impugned.\nTimagenes was born long after these authors, but\ndeserves our praise for the very fact that he revived\nthe credit of history, the writing of which had fallen\ninto neglect. I have not forgotten Xenophon, but\nhe will find his place among the philosophers. There follows a vast army of orators, Athens alone\nhaving produced ten remarkable orators in the\nsame generation. Of these Dermosthenes is far the\ngreatest indeed he came to be regarded almost as\nthe sole pattern of oratory. Such is the force and\ncompactness of his language, so muscular his style,\nso free from tameness and so self-controlled, that\nyou will find nothing in him that is either too much\nor too little. The style of Aesehines is fuller and\nmore diffuse, while his lack of restraint gives an\nappearance of grandeur. But he has more flesh and\nless muscle. Hyperides has extraordinary charm and\npoint, but is better qualified, not to say more useful,\nfor cases of minor importance. Lysias belongs to an\nearlier generation than those whom I have just\nmentioned. He has subtlety and elegance and, if\nthe orator's sole duty were merely to instruct, it\nwould be impossible to conceive greater perfection.\nFor there is nothing irrelevant or far-fetched in his\nspeeches. None the less I would compare him to a\nclear spring rather than to a mighty river. Isocrates\nwas an exponent of a different style of oratory he is\nneat and polished and better suited to the fencingschool than to the battlefield. He elaborated all the\ngraces of style, nor was he without justification. For\nlie had trained himself for the lecture-room and not\nthe law-courts. He is ready in invention, his moral\nideals are high and the care which he bestows upon\nhis rhythm is such as to be a positive fault. I do\nnot regard these as the sole merits of the orators of\nwhom I have spoken, but have selected what seemed\nto me their chief excellences, while those whom I\nhave passed over in silence were far from being\nindifferent. In fact, I will readily admit that the famous Demetrius of Phalerum, who is said to\nhave been the first to set oratory on the downward path, was a man of great talent and eloquence\nand deserves to be remembered, if only for the\nfact that he is almost the last of the Attic\nschool who can be called an orator indeed Cicero\nprefers him to all other orators of the intermediate\nschool. Proceeding to the philosophers, from whom Cicero\nacknowledges that he derived such a large portion\nof his eloquence, we shall all admit that Plato is\nsupreme whether in acuteness or perception or in\nvirtue of his divine gift of style, which is worthy of\nHomer. For he soars high above the levels of\nordinary prose or, as the Greeks call it, pedestrian\nlanguage, and seems to me to be inspired not by\nmere human genius, but, as it were, by the oracles\nof the god of Delphi. Why should I speak of the\nunaffected charm of Xenophon, so far beyond the\npower of affectation to attain The Graces themselves seem to have moulded his style, and we may\nwith the utmost justice say of him, what the writer\nof the old comedy said of Pericles, that the goddess\nof persuasion sat enthroned upon his lips. Why\nshould I dwell on the elegance of the rest of the\nSocratics or on Aristotle, with regard to whom I\nhesitate whether to praise him more for his knowledge, for the multitude of his writings, the sweetness of his style, the penetration revealed by his\ndiscoveries or the variety of the tasks which he essayed In Theophrastus we find such a superhuman brilliance of style that his name is said to be\nderived therefrom. The ancient Stoics indulged\ntheir eloquence comparatively little. Still, they\npleaded the cause of virtue, and the rules which\nthey laid down for argument and proof have been of\nthe utmost value. But they showed themselves\nshrewd thinkers rather than striking orators, which\nindeed they never aimed at being. I now come to Roman authors, and shall follow\nthe same order in dealing with them. As among\nGreek authors Homer provided us with the most\nauspicious opening, so will Virgil among our own.\nFor of all epic poets, Greek or Roman, he, without\ndoubt, most nearly approaches to Homer. I will\nrepeat the words which I heard Domitius Afer use\nin my young days. I asked what poet in his opinion\ncame nearest to Homer, and he replied, And\nin truth, although we must needs bow before the\nimmortal and superhuman genius of Homer, there\nis greater diligence and exactness in the work\nof Virgil just because his task was harder. And\nperhaps the superior uniformity of the Roman's excellence balances Homer's pre-eminence in his outstanding passages. All our other poets follow a long\nway in the rear. Macer and Lucretius are, it is true,\nworth reading, but not for the purpose of forming\nstyle, that is to say, the body of eloquence both\ndeal elegantly with their themes, but the former is\ntame and the latter difficult. The poems by which\nVarro of Atax gained his reputation were translations, but he is by no means to be despised, although\nhis diction is not sufficiently rich to be of much service in developing the resources of eloquence.\nEnnius deserves our reverence, but only as those\ngroves whose age has made them sacred, but whose\nhuge and ancient trunks inspire us with religious\nawe rather than with admiration for their beauty.\nThere are other poets who are nearer in point of\ntime and more useful for our present purpose. Ovid\nhas a lack of seriousness even when he writes epic\nand is unduly enamoured of his own gifts, but\nportions of his work merit our praise. On the other\nhand, although Cornelius Severus is a better versifier\nthan poet, yet if, as has been said, he had written his\npoem on the Sicilian war in the same style throughout\nas his first book, he would have had a just claim to the\nsecond place. A premature death prevented the\npowers of Serranus from ripening to perfection, but\nhis youthful works reveal the highest talent and a\ndevotion to the true ideal of poetry, which is remarkable in one so young. We have suffered serious loss\nin the recent death of Valerius Flaccus. Saleius\nBassus showed an ardent and genuinely poetic\ngenius, but, like that of Serranus, it was not\nmellowed by years. Rabirius and Pedo deserve\nto be studied by those who have the time. Lucan\nis fiery and passionate and remarkable for the\ngrandeur of his general reflexions, but, to be frank,\nI consider that he is more suitable for imitation by\nthe orator than by the poet. I have restricted my\nlist of poets to these names, because Germanicus Augustus has been distracted from the study of\npoetry on which he had embarked by his care for\nthe governance of the world, and the gods have\nthought it scarce worthy of his powers that he\nshould be the greatest of poets. But what can be\nmore sublime, more learned, more perfect in every\ndetail than those works to which he devoted himself\nin the seclusion to which he retired after conferring\nthe supreme power upon his father and his brother\nWho could sing of war better than he who wages it\nwith such skill To whom would the goddesses\nthat preside over literature sooner lend an ear To\nwhom would Minerva, his familiar deity, more\nreadily reveal her secrets Future ages shall tell of\nthese things more fully; to-day his glory as a poet\nis dimmed by the splendour of his other virtues.\nBut you will forgive us, Caesar, who worship at the\nshrine of literature, if we refuse to pass by your\nachievements in silence and insist on testifying at\nleast that, as Virgil sings, We also challenge the supremacy of the Greeks in\nelegy. Of our elegiac poets Tibullus seems to me\nto be the most terse and elegant. There are, however, some who prefer Propertius. Ovid is more\nsportive than either, while Gallus is more severe.\nSatire, on the other hand, is all our own. The first\nof our poets to win renown in this connexion was\nLucilius, some of whose devotees are so enthusiastic\nthat they do not hesitate to prefer him not merely\nto all other satirists, but even to all other poets.\nI disagree with them as much as I do with Horace,\nwho holds that Lucilius' verse has a For his learning is\nas remarkable as his freedom of speech, and it is\nthis latter quality that gives so sharp an edge and\nsuch abundance of wit to his satire. Horace is far\nterser and purer in style, and must be awarded the\nfirst place, unless my judgment is led astray by my\naffection for his work. Persius also, although he\nwrote but one book, has acquired a high and\nwell-deserved reputation, while there are other\ndistinguished satirists still living whose praises will\nbe sung by posterity. There is, however, another\nand even older type of satire which derives its\nvariety not merely from verse, but from an admixture of prose as well. Such were the satires\ncomposed by Terentius Varro, the most learned\nof all Romans. He composed a vast number of\nerudite works, and possessed an extraordinary knowledge of the Latin language, of all antiquity and\nof the history of Greece and Rome. But he is\nan author likely to contribute more to the knowledge of the student than to his eloquence. The\niambic has not been popular with Roman poets as a\nseparate form of composition, but is found mixed up\nwith other forms of verse. It may be found in all\nits bitterness in Catullus, Bibaculus and Horace,\nalthough in the last-named the iambic is interrupted\nby the epode. Of our lyric writers Horace is almost\nthe sole poet worth reading for he rises at times to\na lofty grandeur and is full of sprightliness and\ncharm, while there is great variety in his figures, and\nhis boldness in the choice of words is only equalled\nby his felicity. If any other lyric poet is to be\nmentioned, it will be Caesius Bassus, who has but lately passed from us. But he is far surpassed in\ntalent by poets still living. Among writers of tragedy Accius and Pacuvius\nare most remarkable for the force of their general\nreflexions, the weight of their words and the dignity\nof their characters. But they lack polish, and filed\nto put the finishing touches on their works, although\nthe fault was perhaps rather that of the times in\nwhich they lived than of themselves. Accius is\ngenerally regarded as the most vigorous, while those\nwho lay claim to learning regard Pacuvius as the\nmore learned of the two. The Thyestes of Varius\nis a match for any Greek tragedy, and the Medea\nof Ovid shows, in my opinion, to what heights that\npoet might have risen if he had been ready to curb\nhis talents instead of indulging them. Of the\ntragic writers whom I myself have seen, Pomponius\nSecundus is by far the best his older critics thought\nhim insufficiently tragic, but admitted his eminence as\nfar as learning and polish were concerned. Comedy\nis our weakest point. Although Varro quotes Aelius\nStilo as saying that if the Muses wished to speak\nLatin, they would use the language of Plautus,\nalthough the ancients extol Caecilius, and although\nScipio Africanus is credited with the works of\nTerence which are the most elegant of their kind,\nand would be still more graceful if the poet had\nconfined himself to the iambic trimeter, we still\nscarcely succeed in reproducing even a faint shadow\nof the charm of Greek comedy. Indeed, it seems\nto me as though the language of Rome were incapable of reproducing that graceful wit which was granted to Athens alone, and was beyond the reach\nof other Greek dialects to achieve. Afranius excels\nin the purely Roman comedy, but it is to be regretted\nthat he revealed his own character by defiling his\nplots with the introduction of indecent paederastic\nintrigues. In history, however, we hold our own with the\nGreeks. I should not hesitate to match Saillst\nagainst Thucydides, nor would Herodotus resent\nTitus Livius being placed on the same level as himself. For the latter has a wonderful charm and\ntransparency in narrative, while his speeches are\neloquent beyond description; so admirably adapted\nis all that is said both to the circumstances and the\nspeaker; and as regards the emotions, especially\nthe more pleasing of them, I may sum him up by\nsaying that no historian has ever depicted them to\ngreater perfection. Thus it is that, although by\ndifferent means, he has acquired no less fame than\nhas been awarded to the immortal rapidity of Sallust.\nFor I strongly approve of the saying of Servilius\nNonianus, that these historians were equal rather\nthan alike. Servilius, whom I myself have heard,\nis himself remarkable for the force of his intellect,\nand is full of general reflexions, but he is less restrained than the dignity of history demands. But\nthat dignity is admirably maintained, thanks to his\nstyle, by Aufidius Bassus, a slightly earlier writer,\nespecially in his work on the German war he is\nalways praiseworthy, though at times he fails to do\nhis powers full justice. But there still survives to\nadd lustre to this glorious age a man worthy to be\nremembered through all time he is appreciated today, but after generations shall declare his name aloud. The bold utterances of Crenutius also have\ntheir admirers, and deserve their fame, though the\npassages which brought him to his ruin have been\nexpurgated; still that which is left reveals a rich\nstore of lofty animation and fearless reflexions upon\nlife. There are other good writers as well, but I am\nmerely selecting from the different departments of\nliterature, not reviewing complete libraries. But it is our orators, above all, who enable us to\nmatch our Roman eloquence against that of Greece.\nFor I would set Cicero against any one of their\norators without fear of refutation. I know well\nenough what a storm I shall raise by this assertion,\nmore especially since I do not propose for the\nmoment to compare him with Demosthenes; for\nthere would be no point in such a comparison, as I\nconsider that Demosthenes should be the object of\nspecial study, and not merely studied, but even committed to memory. I regard the excellences of these\ntwo orators as being for the most part similar, that\nis to say, their judgment, their gift of arrangement,\ntheir methods of division, preparation and proof, as\nwell as everything concerned with invention. In\ntheir actual style there is some difference. Demosthenes is more concentrated, Cicero more diffuse;\nDemosthenes makes his periods shorter than Cicero,\nand his weapon is the rapier, whereas Cicero's periods\nare longer, and at times he employs the bludgeon as\nwell nothing can be taken from the former, nor\nadded to the latter; the Greek reveals a more\nstudied, the Roman a more natural art. As regards\nwit and the power of exciting pity, the two most\npowerful instruments where the feelings are concerned, we have the advantage. Again, it is possible that Demosthenes was deprived by national custom\nof the opportunity of producing powerful perorations, but against this may be set the fact that the\ndifferent character of the Latin language debars us\nfrom the attainment of those qualities which are\nso much admired by the adherents of the Attic\nschool. As regards their letters, which have in\nboth cases survived, and dialogues, which Demosthenes never attempted, there can be no comparison\nbetween the two. But, on the other hand, there is\none point in which the Greek has the undoubted\nsuperiority he comes first in point of time, and it\nwas largely due to him that Cicero was able to attain\ngreatness. For it seems to me that Cicero, who\ndevoted himself heart and soul to the imitation of\nthe Greeks, succeeded in reproducing the force of\nDemosthenes, the copious flow of Plato, and the\ncharm of Isocrates. But he did something more\nthan reproduce the best elements in each of these\nauthors by dint of careful study; it was to himself\nthat he owed most of, or rather all his excellences,\nwhich spring from the extraordinary fertility of his\nimmortal genius. For he does not, as Pindar says, since Providence at his birth conferred\nthis special privilege upon him, that eloquence should\nmake trial of all her powers in him. For who can\ninstruct with greater thoroughness, or more deeply\nstir the emotions Who has ever possessed such a\ngift of charm He seems to obtain as a boon what\nin reality he extorts by force, and when he wrests\nthe judge from the path of his own judgment, the\nlatter seems not to be swept away, but merely to\nfollow. Further, there is such weight in all that he says that his audience feel ashamed to disagree with\nhim, and the zeal of the advocate is so transfigured\nthat it has the effect of the sworn evidence of a\nwitness, or the verdict of a judge. And at the same\ntime all these excellences, of which scarce one could\nbe attained by the ordinary man even by the most\nconcentrated effort, flow from him with every appearance of spontaneity, and his style, although no fairer\nhas ever fallen on the ears of men, none the less\ndisplays the utmost felicity and ease. It was not,\ntherefore, without good reason that his own contemporaries spoke of his at the bar, and\nthat for posterity the name of Cicero has come to be\nregarded not as the name of a man, but as the name\nof eloquence itself. Let us, therefore, fix our eyes on\nhim, take him as our pattern, and let the student realise\nthat he has made real progress if he is a passionate\nadmirer of Cicero. Asinius Pollio had great gifts of\ninvention and great precision of language indeed,\nsome think him too precise, while his judgment\nand spirit were fully adequate. But he is so far from\nequalling the polish and charm of Cicero that he\nmight have been born a generation before him.\nMessala, on the other hand, is polished and transparent and displays his nobility in his utterance,\nbut he fails to do his powers full justice. As\nfor Gaius Caesar, if he had had leisure to devote\nhimself to the courts, he would have been the one\norator who could have been considered a serious rival\nto Cicero. Such are his force, his penetration and\nhis energy that we realise that he was as vigorous in\nspeech as in his conduct of war. And yet all these\nqualities are enhanced by a marvellous elegance of\nlanguage, of which he was an exceptionally zealous student. Caelius has much natural talent and much\nwit, more especially when speaking for the prosecution, and deserved a wiser mind and a longer life.\nI have come across some critics who preferred\nCalvus to all other orators, and others again who\nagreed with Cicero that too severe self-criticism had\nrobbed him of his natural vigour. But he was the\npossessor of a solemn, weighty and chastened style,\nwhich was also capable at times of genuine vehemence. He was an adherent of the Attic school and\nan untimely death deprived him of his full meed of\nhonour, at least if we regard him as likely to have\nacquired fresh qualities. Servius Sulpicius acquired\na great and well-deserved reputation by his three\nspeeches. Cassius Severus, if read with discrimination, will provide much that is worthy of imitation\nif to his other merits he had added appropriateness\nof tone and dignity of style, he would deserve a\nplace among the greatest. For his natural talents\nare great, his gift of bitterness, wit and passion\nremarkable, but he allowed the sharpness of his\ntemper to prevail over his judgment. Moreover,\nthough his jests are pungent enough, this very\npungency often turned the laugh against himself.\nThere are many other clever speakers, but it\nwould be a long task to deal with them all. Domitius\nAfer and Julius Africanus are by far the most distinguished. The former is superior in art and in\nevery department of oratory, indeed he may he\nranked with the old orators without fear of contradiction. The latter shows greater energy, but is too\ngreat a precisian in the choice of words, prone to\ntediously long periods and somewhat extravagant in\nhis metaphors. There have been distinguished\ntalents even of more recent date. For example,\nTrachalus was, as a rule, elevated and sufficiently\nclear in his language one realised that his aims\nwere high, but he was better to listen to than to\nread. For his voice was, in my experience, unique\nin its beauty of tone, while his delivery would have\ndone credit to an actor, his action was full of grace\nand he possessed every external advantage in profusion. Vibius Crispus, again, was well-balanced,\nagreeable and born to charm, though he was better\nin private than in public cases. Julius Secundus,\nhad he lived longer, would undoubtedly have attained\na great and enduring reputation. For he would have\nacquired, as he was actually acquiring, all that was\nlacking to his qualities, namely, a far greater\npugnacity and a closer attention to substance as well\nas form. But, in spite of the untimeliness of his end,\nhe occupies a high place, thanks to his fluency, the\ngrace with which he set forth whatever he desired,\nthe lucidity, smoothness and beauty of his speech,\nthe propriety revealed in the use of words, even\nwhen employed figuratively, and the point which\ncharacterises even his most hazardous expressions.\nSubsequent writers on the history of oratory will\nfind abundant material for praise among the orators\nwho flourish to-day for the law courts can boast\na glorious wealth of talent. Indeed, the consummate advocates of the present day are serious\nrivals of the ancients, while enthusiastic effort\nand lofty ideals lead many a young student to tread in their footsteps and imitate their\nexcellence. I have still to deal with writers on philosophy,\nof whom Rome has so far produced but few who are\ndistinguished for their style. But Cicero, who is\ngreat in every department of literature, stands out\nas the rival of Plato in this department as well.\nBrutus was an admirable writer on such themes, in\nwhich he distinguished himself far more than in his\nspeeches he is equal to the serious nature of his\nsubject, and the reader realises that he feels what\nhe says. Cornelius Celsus, a follower of the Sextii,\nwrote a number of philosophical works, which have\nconsiderable grace and polish. Among the Stoics\nPlautus is useful as giving a knowledge of the\nsubject. Among the Epicureans Catius is agreeable to read, though lacking in weight. I have\ndeliberately postponed the discussion of Seneca in\nconnexion with the various departments of literature\nowing to the fact that there is a general, though\nfalse, impression that I condemn and even detest\nhim. It is true that I had occasion to pass censure upon him when I was endeavouring to recall\nstudents from a depraved style, weakened by every\nkind of error, to a severer standard of taste. But\nat that time Seneca's works were in the hands\nof every young man, and my aim was not to ban his\nreading altogether, but to prevent his being preferred to authors superior to himself, but whom he\nwas never tired of disparaging; for, being conscious\nof the fact that his own style was very different from theirs, he was afraid that he would fail to\nplease those who admired them. But the young\nmen loved him rather than imitated him, and fell\nas far below him as he fell below the ancients. For\nI only wish they had equalled or at least approached\nhis level. But he pleased them for his faults alone,\nand each individual sought to imitate such of those\nfaults as lay within his capacity to reproduce and\nthen brought reproach on his master by boasting\nthat he spoke in the genuine Senecan manner.\nSeneca had many excellent qualities, a quick and\nfertile intelligence with great industry and wide\nknowledge, though as regards the last quality he\nwas often led into error by those whom he had\nentrusted with the task of investigating certain\nsubjects on his behalf. He dealt with almost every\ndepartment of knowledge; for speeches, poems,\nletters and dialogues all circulate under his name.\nIn philosophy he showed a lack of critical power,\nbut was none the less quite admirable in his\ndenunciations of vice. His works contain a number\nof striking general reflexions and much that is\nworth reading for edification; but his style is for\nthe most part corrupt and exceedingly dangerous,\nfor the very reason that its vices are so many and\nattractive. One could wish that, while he relied on\nhis own intelligence, he had allowed himself to be\nguided by the taste of others. For if he had only\ndespised all unnatural expressions and had not been\nso passionately fond of all that was incorrect, if he\nhad not felt such affection for all that was his own,\nand had not impaired the solidity of his matter by\nstriving after epigrammatic brevity, he would have\nwon the approval of the learned instead of the enthusiasm of boys. But even as it is, he deserves\nto be read by those whose powers have been formed\nand firmly moulded on the standards of a severer\ntaste, if only because he will exercise their critical\nfaculties in distinguishing between his merits and\nhis defects. For, as I have said, there is much in\nhim which we may approve, much even that we may\nadmire. Only we must be careful in our selection\nwould he had been as careful himself. For his\ngenius deserved to be devoted to better aims, since\nwhat it does actually aim at, it succeeds in achieving. II. It is from these and other authors worthy of\nour study that we must draw our stock of words, the\nvariety of our figures and our methods of composition,\nwhile we must form our minds on the model of every\nexcellence. For there can be no doubt that in art\nno small portion of our task lies in imitation, since,\nalthough invention came first and is all-important, it\nis expedient to imitate whatever has been invented\nwith success. And it is a universal rule of life that\nwe should wish to copy what we approve in others.\nIt is for this reason that boys copy the shapes of\nletters that they may learn to write, and that\nmusicians take the voices of their teachers, painters\nthe works of their predecessors, and peasants the\nprinciples of agriculture which have been proved in\npractice, as models for their imitation. In fact, we\nmay note that the elementary study of every branch\nof learning is directed by reference to some definite\nstandard that is placed before the learner. We\nmust, in fact, either be like or unlike those who\nhave proved their excellence. It is rare for nature\nto produce such resemblance, which is more often\nthe result of imitation. But the very fact that in every subject the procedure to be followed is so\nmuch more easy for us than it was for those who\nhad no model to guide them, is a positive drawback,\nunless we use this dubious advantage with caution\nand judgment. The first point, then, that we must realise is that\nimitation alone is not sufficient, if only for the reason\nthat a sluggish nature is only too ready to rest\ncontent with the inventions of others. For what\nwould have happened in the days when models were\nnot, if men had decided to do and think of nothing\nthat they did not know already The answer is\nobvious nothing would ever have been discovered.\nWhy, then, is it a crime for us to discover something\nnew Were primitive men led to make so many\ndiscoveries simply by the natural force of their\nimagination, and shall we not then be spurred on to\nsearch for novelty by the very knowledge that those\nwho sought of old were rewarded by success And\nseeing that they, who had none to teach them anything, have handed down such store of knowledge\nto posterity, shall we refuse to employ the experience\nwhich we possess of some things, to discover yet\nother things, and possess nought that is not owed to\nthe beneficent activity of others Shall we follow\nthe example of those painters whose sole aim is to\nbe able to copy pictures by using the ruler and the\nmeasuring rod It is a positive disgrace to be\ncontent to owe all our achievement to imitation.\nFor what, I ask again, would have been the result\nif no one had done more than his predecessors\nLivius Andronicus would mark our supreme\nachievement in poetry and the annals of the Pontifices would be our ne plus ultra in history. We should still be sailing on rafts, and the art of painting\nwould be restricted to tracing a line round a shadow\nthrown in the sunlight. Cast your eyes over the\nwhole of history; you will find that no art has\nremained just as it was when it was discovered, nor\ncome to a standstill at its very birth, unless indeed\nwe are ready to pass special condensation on our\nown generation on the ground that it is so barren of\ninvention that no further development is possible;\nand it is undoubtedly true that no development is\npossible for those who restrict themselves to imitation. But if we are forbidden to add anything to\nthe existing stock of knowledge, how can we ever\nhope for the birth of our ideal orator For of all\nthe greatest orators with whom we are as yet acquainted, there is not one who has not some\ndeficiency or blemish. And even those who do\nnot aim at supreme excellence, ought to press\ntoward the mark rather than be content to follow\nin the tracks of others. For the man whose aim\nis to prove himself better than another, even if he\ndoes not surpass him, may hope to equal him. But\nhe can never hope to equal him, if he thinks it his\nduty merely to tread in his footsteps for the mere\nfollower must always lag behind. Further, it is\ngenerally easier to make some advance than to\nrepeat what has been done by others, since there\nis nothing harder than to produce an exact likeness,\nand nature herself has so far failed in this endeavour\nthat there is always some difference which enables\nus to distinguish even the things which seem most\nlike and most equal to one another. Again, whatever is like another object, must necessarily be\ninferior to the object of its imitation, just as the shadow is inferior to the substance, the portrait to\nthe features which it portrays, and the acting of the\nplayer to the feelings which he endeavours to reproduce. The same is true of oratory. For the models\nwhich we select for imitation have a genuine and\nnatural force, whereas all imitation is artificial and\nmoulded to a purpose which was not that of the\noriginal orator. This is the reason why declamations\nhave less life and vigour than actual speeches, since\nthe subject is fictitious in the one and real in the\nother. Again, the greatest qualities of the orator\nare beyond all imitation, by which I mean, talent,\ninvention, force, facility and all the qualities which\nare independent of art. Consequently, there are\nmany who, after excerpting certain words from\npublished speeches or borrowing certain particular\nrhythms, think that they have produced a perfect\ncopy of the works which they have read, despite\nthe fact that words become obsolete or current\nwith the lapse of years, the one sure standard being\ncontemporary usage; and they are not good or\nbad in virtue of their inherent nature for in themselves they are no more than mere sounds, but\nsolely in virtue of the aptitude and propriety or\nthe reverse with which they are arranged, while\nrhythmical composition must be adapted to the\ntheme in hand and will derive its main charm from\nits variety. Consequently the nicest judgment is required in\nthe examination of everything connected with this\ndepartment of study. First we must consider whom\nto imitate. For there are many who have shown a\npassionate desire to imitate the worst and most\ndecadent authors. Secondly, we must consider what it is that we should set ourselves to imitate in the\nauthors thus chosen. For even great authors have\ntheir blemishes, for which they have been censured\nby competent critics and have even reproached each\nother. I only wish that imitators were more likely\nto improve on the good things than to exaggerate\nthe blemishes of the authors whom they seek to\ncopy. And even those who have sufficient critical\nacumen to avoid the faults of their models will not\nfind it sufficient to produce a copy of their merits,\namounting to no more than a superficial resemblance,\nor rather recalling those sloughs which, according to\nEpicurus, are continually given off by material things.\nBut this is just what happens to those who mould\nthemselves on the first impressions derived from the\nstyle of their model, without devoting themselves to\na thorough investigation of its good qualities, and,\ndespite the brilliance of their imitation and the close\nresemblance of their language and rhythm, not only\nfail absolutely to attain the force of style and invention\npossessed by the original, but as a rule degenerate\ninto something worse, and achieve merely those faults\nwhich are hardest to distinguish from virtues they\nare turgid instead of grand, bald instead of concise,\nand rash instead of courageous, while extravagance\ntakes the place of wealth, over-emphasis the place of\nharmony and negligence of simplicity. As a result,\nthose who flaunt tasteless and insipid thoughts,\ncouched in an uncouth and inharmonious form, think\nthat they are the equals of the ancients; those who\nlack ornament and epigram, pose as Attic; those\nwho darken their meaning by the abruptness with\nwhich they close their periods, count themselves the\nsuperiors of Sallust and Thucydides; those who are dreary and jejune, think that they are serious rivals\nto Pollio, while those who are tame and listless, if\nonly they can produce long enough periods, swear\nthat this is just the manner in which Cicero would\nhave spoken. I have known some who thought that\nthey had produced a brilliant imitation of the style\nof that divine orator, by ending their periods with\nthe phrase esse videatur. Consequently it is of the\nfirst importance that every student should realise\nwhat it is that he is to imitate, and should know\nwhy it is good. The next step is for each student to consult his\nown powers when he shoulders his burden. For\nthere are some things which, though capable of\nimitation, may be beyond the capacity of any given\nindividual, either because his natural gifts are insufficient or of a different character. The man whose\ntalent is for the plain style should not seek only\nwhat is bold and rugged, nor yet should he who has\nvigour without control suffer himself through love of\nsubtlety at once to waste his natural energy and\nfail to attain the elegance at which he aims for\nthere is nothing so unbecoming as delicacy wedded\nto ruggedness. True, I did express the opinion\nthat the instructor whose portrait I painted in my\nsecond book, should not confine himself to teaching\nthose things for which he perceived his individual\npupils to have most aptitude. For it is his further\nduty to foster whatever good qualities he may perceive in his pupils, to make good their deficiencies\nas far as may be, to correct their faults and turn\nthem to better things. For he is the guide and\ndirector of the minds of others. It is a harder task\nto mould one's own nature. But not even our ideal teacher, however much he may desire that\neverything that is correct should prevail in his\nschool to the fullest extent, will waste his labour in\nattempting to develop qualities to the attainment of\nwhich he perceives nature's gifts to be opposed. It is also necessary to avoid the fault to which the\nmajority of students are so prone, namely, the idea\nthat in composing speeches we should imitate the\npoets and historians, and in writing history or poetry\nshould copy orators and declaimers. Each branch\nof literature has its own laws and its own appropriate\ncharacter. Comedy does not seek to increase its\nheight by the buskin and tragedy does not wear\nthe slipper of comedy. But all forms of eloquence\nhave something in common, and it is to the imitation\nof this common element that our efforts should be\nconfined. There is a further fault to which those persons\nare liable who devote themselves entirely to the\nimitation of one particular style if the rude vigour\nof some particular author takes their fancy, they\ncling to it even when the case on which they are\nengaged calls for an easy and flowing style; if, on\nthe other hand, it is a simple or agreeable style that\nclaims their devotion, they fail to meet the heavy\ndemands of severe and weighty cases. For not only\ndo cases differ in their general aspect, but one part\nof a case may differ from another, and some things\nrequire a gentle and others a violent style, some\nrequire an impetuous and others a calm diction, while\nin some cases it is necessary to instruct and in others\nto move the audience, in all these instances dissimilar and different methods being necessary. Consequently I should be reluctant even to advise a student to select one particular author to follow\nthrough thick and thin. Demosthenes is by far the\nmost perfect of Greek orators, yet there are some\nthings which others have said better in some contexts\nas against the many things which he has said better\nthan others. But it does not follow that because we\nshould select one author for special imitation, he\nshould be our only model. What then Is it not\nsufficient to model our every utterance on Cicero\nFor my own part, I should consider it sufficient, if\nI could always imitate him successfully. But what\nharm is there in occasionally borrowing the vigour of\nCaesar, the vehemence of Caelius, the precision of\nPollio or the sound judgment of Calvus For quite\napart from the fact that a wise man should always,\nif possible, make whatever is best in each individual\nauthor his own, we shall find that, in view of the\nextreme difficulty of our subject, those who fix their\neyes on one model only will always find some one\nquality which it is almost impossible to acquire therefrom. Consequently, since it is practically impossible\nfor mortal powers to produce a perfect and complete\ncopy of any one chosen author, we shall do well to\nkeep a number of different excellences before our\neyes, so that different qualities from different authors\nmay impress themselves on our minds, to be adopted\nfor use in the place that becomes them best. But imitation for I must repeat this point again\nand again should not be confined merely to words.\nWe must consider the appropriateness with which\nthose orators handle the circumstances and persons\ninvolved in the various cases in which they were\nengaged, and observe the judgment and powers of\narrangement which they reveal, and the manner in which everything they say, not excepting those\nportions of their speeches which seem designed\nmerely to delight their audience, is concentrated on\nsecuring the victory over their opponents. We must\nnote their procedure in the exordium, the method\nand variety of their statement of facts, the power\ndisplayed in proof and refutation, the skill revealed\nin their appeal to every kind of emotion, and the\nmanner in which they make use of popular applause\nto serve their case, applause which is most honourable when it is spontaneous and not deliberately\ncourted. If we have thoroughly appreciated all these\npoints, we shall be able to imitate our models with\naccuracy. But the man who to these good qualities\nadds his own, that is to say, who makes good deficiencies and cuts down whatever is redundant, will\nbe the perfect orator of our search; and it is now\nabove all times that such perfection should be\nattained when there are before us so many more\nmodels of oratorical excellence than were available\nfor those who have thus far achieved the highest\nsuccess. For this glory also shall be theirs, that\nmen shall say of them that while they surpassed\ntheir predecessors, they also taught those who came\nafter. Such are the aids which we may derive from\nexternal sources; as regards those which we must\nsupply for ourselves, it is the pen which brings at\nonce the most labour and the most profit. Cicero is\nfully justified in describing it as the best producer\nand teacher of eloquence, and it may be noted\nthat in the de Oratore he supports his own\njudgment by the authority of Lucius Crassus, in\nwhose mouth he places this remark. We must therefore write as much as possible and with the\nutmost care. For as deep ploughing makes the soil\nmore fertile for the production and support of crops,\nso, if we improve our minds by something more than\nmere superficial study, we shall produce a richer\ngrowth of knowledge and shall retain it with greater\naccuracy. For without the consciousness of such\npreliminary study our powers of speaking extempore\nwill give us nothing but an empty flow of words,\nspringing from the lips and not from the brain. It\nis in writing that eloquence has its roots and foundations, it is writing that provides that holy of holies\nwhere the wealth of oratory is stored, and whence it\nis produced to meet the demands of sudden emergencies. It is of the first importance that we should\ndevelop such strength as will not faint under the\ntoil of forensic strife nor be exhausted by continual\nuse. For it is an ordinance of nature that nothing\ngreat can be achieved in a moment, and that all the\nfairest tasks are attended with difficulty, while on\nbirths as well she has imposed this law, that the\nlarger the animal, the longer should be the period of\ngestation. There are, however, two questions which present\nthemselves in this connexion, namely, what should\nbe our method and what the subjects on which\nwe write, and I propose to treat them in this\norder. At first, our pen must be slow yet sure we\nmust search for what is best and refuse to give a\njoyful welcome to every thought the moment that\nit presents itself; we must first criticise the fruits of\nour imagination, and then, once approved, arrange\nthem with care. For we must select both thoughts\nand words and weigh them one by one. This done, we must consider the order in which they should be\nplaced, and must examine all the possible varieties\nof rhythm, refusing necessarily to place each word in\nthe order in which it occurs to us. In order to do\nthis with the utmost care, we must frequently revise\nwhat we have just written. For beside the fact that\nthus we secure a better connexion between what\nfollows and what precedes, the warmth of thought\nwhich has cooled down while we were writing is\nrevived anew, and gathers fresh impetus from going\nover the ground again. We may compare this protess with what occurs in jumping matches. The\ncompetitors take a longer run and go at full speed\nto clear the distance which they aim at covering;\nsimilarly, in throwing the javelin, we draw back our\narms, and in archery pull back the bow-string to\npropel the shaft. At times, however, we may\nspread our sails before the favouring breeze, but we\nmust beware that this indulgence does not lead us\ninto error. For we love all the offspring of our\nthought at the moment of their birth; were that\nnot so, we should never commit them to writing.\nBut we must give them a critical revision, and go\ncarefully over any passage where we have reason to\nregard our fluency with suspicion. It is thus, we\nare told, that Sallust wrote, and certainly his works\ngive clear evidence of the labour which he expended\non them. Again, we learn from Varius that Virgil\ncomposed but a very small number of verses every\nday. It is true that with orators the case is somewhat different, and it is for this reason that I\nenjoin such slowness of speed and such anxious care\nat the outset. For the first aim which we must fix\nin our minds and insist on carrying into execution is to write as well as possible; speed will come with\npractice. Gradually thoughts will suggest themselves with increasing readiness, the words will\nanswer to our call and rhythmical arrangement will\nfollow, till everything will be found fulfilling its\nproper function as in a well-ordered household.\nThe sum of the whole matter is this write quickly\nand you will never write well, write well and you\nwill soon write quickly. But it is just when we\nhave acquired this facility that we must pause awhile\nto look ahead and, if I may use the metaphor, curb\nthe horses that would run away with us. This will\nnot delay our progress so much as lend us fresh\nvigour. For I do not think that those who have\nacquired a certain power in writing should be condemned to the barren pains of false self-criticism.\nHow can anyone fulfil his duties as an advocate if he\nwastes his time in putting unnecessary finish on each\nportion of his pleadings There are some who are\nnever satisfied. They wish to change everything\nthey have written and to put it in other words.\nThey are a diffident folk, and deserve but ill of their\nown talents, who think it a mark of precision to cast\nobstacles in the way of their own writing. Nor is it\neasy to say which are the most serious offenders, those\nwho are satisfied with everything or those who are\nsatisfied with nothing that they write. For it is\nof common occurrence with young men, however\ntalented they may be, to waste their gifts by superfluous elaboration, and to sink into silence through\nan excessive desire to speak well. I remember in\nthis connexion a story that Julius Secundus, my contemporary, and, as is well known, my very dear friend,\na man with remarkable powers of eloquence, but with an infinite passion for precision, told me of the\nwords once used to him by his uncle, Julius Florus,\nthe leading orator of Gaul, for it was there that he\npractised, a man eloquent as but few have ever\nbeen, and worthy of his nephew. He once noticed\nthat Secundus, who was still a student, was looking\ndepressed, and asked him the meaning of his frowns.\nThe youth made no concealment of the reason he\nhad been working for three days, and had been unable, in spite of all his efforts, to devise an exordium\nfor the theme which he had been given to write,\nwith the result that he was not only vexed over\nhis immediate difficulty, but had lost all hope of\nfuture success. Florus smiled and said, There\nlies the truth of the whole matter. We must aim\nat speaking as well as we can, but must not try to\nspeak better than our nature will permit. For to\nmake any real advance we need study, not selfaccusation. And it is not merely practice that will\nenable us to write at greater length and with\nincreased fluency, although doubtless practice is\nmost important. We need judgement as well. So\nlong as we do not he back with eyes turned up to the\nceiling, trying to fire our imagination by muttering\nto ourselves, in the hope that something will present\nitself, but turn our thoughts to consider what the\ncircumstances of the case demand, what suits the\ncharacters involved, what is the nature of the occasion and the temper of the judge, we shall acquire\nthe power of writing by rational means. It is thus\nthat nature herself bids us begin and pursue our\nstudies once well begun. For most points are of a\ndefinite character and, if we keep our eyes open, will spontaneously present themselves. That is the\nreason why peasants and uneducated persons do not\nbeat about the bush to discover with what they\nshould begin, and our hesitation is all the more\nshameful if it is simply the result of education.\nWe must not, therefore, persist in thinking that\nwhat is hard to find is necessarily best; for, if it\nseems to us that there is nothing to be said except\nthat which we are unable to find, we must say\nnothing at all. On the other hand, there is a fault\nwhich is precisely the opposite of this, into which\nthose fall who insist on first making a rapid draft\nof their subject with the utmost speed of which\ntheir pen is capable, and write in the heat and\nimpulse of the moment. They call this their rough\ncopy. They then revise what they have written,\nand arrange their hasty outpourings. But while\nthe words and the rhythm may be corrected, the\nmatter is still marked by the superficiality resulting\nfrom the speed with which it was thrown together.\nThe more correct method is, therefore, to exercise\ncare from the very beginning, and to form the\nwork from the outset in such a manner that it\nmerely requires to be chiselled into shape, not\nfashioned anew. Sometimes, however, we must\nfollow the stream of our emotions, since their\nwarmth will give us more than any diligence can\nsecure. The condemnation which I have passed on such\ncarelessness in writing will make it pretty clear what\nmy views are on the luxury of dictation which\nis now so fashionable. For, when we write, however\ngreat our speed, the fact that the hand cannot follow\nthe rapidity of our thoughts gives us time to think, whereas the presence of our amanuensis hurries us\non, and at times we feel ashamed to hesitate or\npause, or make some alteration, as though we were\nafraid to display such weakness before a witness.\nAs a result our language tends not merely to be\nhaphazard and formless, but in our desire to produce\na continuous flow we let slip positive improprieties\nof diction, which show neither the precision of the\nwriter nor the impetuosity of the speaker. Again, if\nthe amanuensis is a slow writer, or lacking in intelligence, he becomes a stumbling-block, our speed is\nchecked, and the thread of our ideas is interrupted\nby the delay or even perhaps by the loss of\ntemper to which it gives rise. Moreover, the\ngestures which accompany strong feeling, and sometimes even serve to stimulate the mind, the waving\nof the hand, the contraction of the brow, the\noccasional striking of forehead or side, and those\nwhich Persius notes when he describes a trivial\nstyle as one that all these become ridiculous, unless we are alone,\nFinally, we come to the most important consideration of all, that the advantages of privacy are lost\nwhen we dictate. Everyone, however, will agree\nthat the absence of company and deep silence are\nmost conducive to writing, though I would not go\nso far as to concur in the opinion of those who think\nwoods and groves the most suitable localities for\nthe purpose, on the ground that the freedom of\nthe sky and the charm of the surroundings produce\nsublimity of thought and wealth of inspiration.\nPersonally I regard such an environment as a pleasant luxury rather than a stimulus to study.\nFor whatever causes us delight, must necessarily\ndistract us from the concentration due to our work.\nThe mind cannot devote its undivided and sincere\nattention to a number of things at the same time,\nand wherever it turns its gaze it must cease to\ncontemplate its appointed task. Therefore, the\ncharm of the woods, the gliding of the stream, the\nbreeze that murmurs in the branches, the song of\nbirds, and the very freedom with which our eyes\nmay range, are mere distractions, and in my opinion\nthe pleasure which they excite is more likely to\nrelax than to concentrate our attention. Demosthenes took a wiser view; for he would retire to\na place where no voice was to be heard, and no\nprospect greeted the sight, for fear that his eyes\nmight force his mind to neglect its duty. Therefore, let the burner of the midnight oil seclude\nhimself in the silence of night, within closed doors,\nwith but a solitary lamp to light his labours. But\nfor every kind of study, and more especially for\nnight work, good health and its chief source, simple\nliving, are essential; for we have fallen into the\nhabit of devoting to relentless labour the hour which\nnature has appointed for rest and relaxation. From\nthose hours we must take only such time as is superfluous for sleep, and will not be missed. For fatigue\nwill make us careless in writing, and the hours of\ndaylight are amply sufficient for one who has no\nother distractions. It is only the busy man who\nis driven to encroach on the hours of darkness.\nNevertheless, night work, so long as we come to it\nfiesh and untired, provides by far the best form of\nprivacy. But although silence and seclusion and absolute\nfreedom of mind are devoutly to be desired, they\nare not always within our power to attain. Consequently we must not fling aside our book at once,\nif disturbed by some noise, and lament that we\nhave lost a day on the contrary, we must make\na firm stand against such inconveniences, and train\nourselves so to concentrate our thoughts as to rise\nsuperior to all impediments to study. If only you\ndirect all your attention to the work which you\nhave in hand, no sight or sound will ever penetrate\nto your mind. If even casual thoughts often occupy\nus to such an extent that we do not see passers-by,\nor even stray from our path, surely we can obtain\nthe same result by the exercise of our will. We\nmust not give way to pretexts for sloth. For unless\nwe make up our mind that we must be fresh, cheerful and free from all other care when we approach our\nstudies, we shall always find some excuse for idleness.\nTherefore, whether we be in a crowd, on a journey,\nor even at some festive gathering, our thoughts should\nalways have some inner sanctuary of their own to\nwhich they may retire. Otherwise what shall we\ndo when we are suddenly called upon to deliver\na set speech in the midst of the forum, with lawsuits in progress on every side, and with the sound\nof quarrels and even casual outcries in our ears, if\nwe need absolute privacy to discover the thoughts\nwhich we jot down upon our tablets It was for\nthis reason that Demosthenes, the passionate lover\nof seclusion, used to study on the seashore amid the\nroar of the breakers that they might teach him not\nto be unnerved by the uproar of the public assembly. There are also certain minor details which deserve our attention, for there is nothing too minute for the\nstudent. It is best to write on wax owing to the\nfacility which it offers for erasure, though weak\nsight may make it desirable to employ parchment\nby preference. The latter, however, although of\nassistance to the eye, delays the hand and interrupts\nthe stream of thought owing to the frequency with\nwhich the pen has to be supplied with ink. But\nwhichever we employ, we must leave blank pages\nthat we may be free to make additions when we\nwill. For lack of space at times gives rise to a\nreluctance to make corrections, or, at any rate, is\nliable to cause confusion when new matter is\ninserted. The wax tablets should not be unduly\nwide; for I have known a young and over-zealous\nstudent write his compositions at undue length,\nbecause he measured them by the number of lines,\na fault which persisted, in spite of frequent admonition, until his tablets were changed, when it\ndisappeared. Space must also be left for jotting\ndown the thoughts which occur to the writer out\nof due order, that is to say, which refer to subjects\nother than those in hand. For sometimes the most\nadmirable thoughts break in upon us which cannot\nbe inserted in what we are writing, but which, on\nthe other hand, it is unsafe to put by, since they are\nat times forgotten, and at times cling to the memory\nso persistently as to divert us from some other line\nof thought. They are, therefore, best kept in\nstore. The next point which we have to consider is\nthe correction of our work, which is by far the most\nuseful portion of our study for there is good reason\nfor the view that erasure is quite as important a function of the pen as actual writing. Correction\ntakes the form of addition, excision and alteration.\nBut it is a comparatively simple and easy task to\ndecide what is to be added or excised. On the\nother hand, to prune what is turgid, to elevate\nwhat is mean, to repress exuberance, arrange what\nis disorderly, introduce rhythm where it is lacking,\nand modify it where it is too emphatic, involves a\ntwofold labour. For we have to condemn what had\npreviously satisfied us and discover what had escaped\nour notice. There can be no doubt that the best\nmethod of correction is to put aside what we have\nwritten for a certain time, so that when we return\nto it after an interval it will have the air of novelty\nand of being another's handiwork; for thus we may\nprevent ourselves from regarding our writings with\nall the affection that we lavish on a newborn child.\nBut this is not always possible, especially in the case\nof an orator who most frequently has to write for\nimmediate use, while some limit, after all, must be\nset to correction. For there are some who return\nto everything they write with the presumption that\nit is full of faults and, assuming that a first draft\nmust necessarily be incorrect, think every change\nan improvement and make some alteration as often\nas they have the manuscript in their hands they\nare, in fact, like doctors who use the knife even\nwhere the flesh is perfectly healthy. The result of\ntheir critical activities is that the finished work is\nfull of scars, bloodless, and all the worse for their\nanxious care. No let there be something in all our writing which, if it does not actually please us,\nat least passes muster, so that the file may only\npolish our work, not wear it away. There must also be a limit to the time which we spend on its\nrevision. For the fact that Cinna took nine years\nto write his Smyrna, and that Isocrates required\nten years, at the lowest estimate, to complete his\nPanegyric does not concern the orator, whose\nassistance will be of no use, if it is so long\ndelayed. My next task is to indicate what those should\nwrite whose aim is to acquire facility. At this part\nof my work there is no necessity for me to set forth\nthe subjects which should be selected for writing,\nor the order in which they should be approached,\nsince I have already done this in the first book,\nwhere I prescribed the sequence of studies for boys,\nand in the second book, where I did the same for\nyoung men. The point which concerns me now is\nto show from what sources copiousness and facility\nmay most easily be derived. Our earlier orators thought highly of translation\nfrom Greek into Latin. In the de Oratore of\nCicero, Lucius Crassus says that he practised this\ncontinually, while Cicero himself advocates it again\nand again, nay, he actually published translations\nof Xenophon and Plato, which were the result of\nthis form of exercise. Messala likewise gave it his\napproval, and we have a number of translations of\nspeeches from his hand; he even succeeded in\ncoping with the delicacy of Hyperides' speech in\ndefence of Phryne, a task of exceeding difficulty for\na Roman. The purpose of this form of exercise is\nobvious. For Greek authors are conspicuous for the\nvariety of their matter, and there is much art in\nall their eloquence, while, when we translate them,\nwe are at liberty to use the best words available, since all that we use are our very own. As regards\nfigures, too, which are the chief ornament of oratory,\nit is necessary to think out a great number and variety\nfor ourselves, since in this respect the Roman idiom\ndiffers largely from the Greek. But paraphrase from the Latin will also be of\nmuch assistance, while I think we shall all agree that\nthis is specially valuable with regard to poetry;\nindeed, it is said that the paraphrase of poetry was\nthe sole form of exercise employed by Sulpicius.\nFor the lofty inspiration of verse serves to elevate\nthe orator's style and the bold license of poetic\nlanguage does not preclude our attempting to\nrender the same words in the language natural to\nprose. Nay, we may add the vigour of oratory\nto the thoughts expressed by the poet, make good\nhis omissions, and prune his diffuseness. But I\nwould not have paraphrase restrict itself to the\nbare interpretation of the original its duty is\nrather to rival and vie with the original in the\nexpression of the same thoughts. Consequently,\nI disagree with those who forbid the student to\nparahrase speeches of our own orators, on the\nground that, since all the best expressions have\nalready been appropriated, whatever we express\ndifferently must necessarily be a change for the\nworse. For it is always possible that we may discover expressions which are an improvement on\nthose which have already been used, and nature\ndid not make eloquence such a poor and starveling\nthing, that there should be only one adequate\nexpression for any one theme. It can hardly be\nargued that, while the gestures of the actor are\ncapable of imparting a wealth of varied meaning to the same words, the power of oratory is restricted\nto a narrower scope, so that when a thing has once\nbeen said, it is impossible to say anything else on\nthe same theme. Why, even if it be granted that\nno new expression we discover can be better than\nor even equal to the old, it may, at any rate, be\na good second. Do we not often speak twice, or\neven more frequently, on the same subject, sometimes even to the extent of a number of sentences\nin succession It will scarce be asserted that we\nmust not match ourselves against others when\nwe are permitted to match ourselves against ourselves. For if there were only one way in which\nanything could be satisfactorily expressed, we\nshould be justified in thinking that the path to\nsuccess had been sealed to us by our predecessors.\nBut, as a matter of fact, the methods of expression\nstill left us are innumerable, and many roads lead\nus to the same goal. Brevity and copiousness each\nhave their own peculiar grace, the merits of metaphor are one thing and of literalness another, and,\nwhile direct expression is most effective in one case,\nin another the best result is gained by a use of\nfigures. Further, the exercise is valuable in virtue\nof its difficulty; and again, there is no better way of\nacquiring a thorough understanding of the greatest\nauthors. For, instead of hurriedly running a careless\neye over their writings, we handle each separate\nphrase and are forced to give it close examination,\nand we come to realise the greatness of their excellence from the very fact that we cannot imitate\nthem. Nor is it only the paraphrase of the works of\nothers that we shall find of advantage much may be gained from paraphrasing our own words in a\nnumber of different ways for instance, we may\nspecially select certain thoughts and recast them\nin the greatest variety of forms, just as a sculptor\nwill fashion a number of different images from the\nsame piece of wax. But it is the simplest subjects\nwhich, in my opinion, will serve us best in our\nattempt to acquire facility. For our lack of talent\nmay easily shelter itself behind the complicated\nmass of detail presented by persons, cases, circumstances of time and place, words and deeds, since\nthe subjects which present themselves on all sides\nare so many that it will always be possible to lay\nhold of some one or other. True merit is revealed\nby the power to expand what is naturally compressed, to amplify what is small, to lend variety\nto sameness, charm to the commonplace, and to\nsay a quantity of good things about a very limited\nnumber of subjects. For this purpose indefinite questions, of the kind\nwe call theses, will be found of the utmost service\nin fact, Cicero still exercised himself upon such\nthemes after he had become the leading man in\nthe state. Akin to these are the proof or refutation of general statements. For such statements\nare a kind of decree or rule, and whatever problem\nmay arise from the thing, may equally arise from the\ndecision passed upon the thing. Then there are\ncommonplaces, which, as we know, have often been\nwritten by orators as a form of exercise. The man\nwho has practised himself in giving full treatment\nto such simple and uncomplicated themes, will\nassuredly find his fluency increased in those subjects\nwhich admit of varied digression, and will be prepared to deal with any case that may confront him,\nsince all cases ultimately turn upon general questions. For what difference is there between the\nspecial case where Cornelius, the tribune of the\npeople, is charged with reading the text of a proposed law, and the general question whether it is\nlse-majest for a magistrate himself to read the\nlaw which he proposes to the people; what does it\nmatter whether we have to decide whether Milo was\njustified in killing Clodius, or whether it is justifiable to kill a man who has set an ambush for his\nslayer, or a citizen whose existence is a danger to\nthe state, even though he has set no such ambush\nWhat difference is there between the question\nwhether it was an honourable act on the part of\nCato to make over Marcia to Hortensius, or whether\nsuch an action is becoming to a virtuous man It is\non the guilt or innocence of specific persons that\njudgement is given, but it is on general principles\nthat the case ultimately rests. As for declamations\nof the kind delivered in the schools of the rhetoricians, so long as they are in keeping with actual\nlife and resemble speeches, they are most profitable\nto the student, not merely while he is still immature,\nfor the reason that they simultaneously exercise the\npowers both of invention and arrangement, but even\nwhen he has finished his education and acquired a\nreputation in the courts. For they provide a richer\ndiet from which eloquence derives nourishment and\nbrilliance of complexion, and at the same time afford\na refreshing variety after the continuous fatigues\nof forensic disputes. For the same reason, the wealth\nof language that marks the historian should be from\ntime to time imported into portions of our written exercises, and we should indulge in the easy freedom of dialogue. Nay, it may even be advantageous\nto amuse ourselves with the writing of verse, just as\nathletes occasionally drop the severe regime of diet\nand exercise to which they are subjected and refresh\nthemselves by taking a rest and indulging in more\ndainty and agreeable viands. Indeed, in my opinion,\none of the reasons why Cicero was enabled to shed\nsuch glory upon the art of speaking is to be found\nin his excursions to such bypaths of study. For if\nall our material was drawn solely from actions at\nlaw, our eloquence must needs lose its gloss, our\nlimbs grow stiff, and the keen edge of the intellect\nbe blunted by its daily combats. But although those who find their practice in the\ncontests of forensic warfare derive fresh strength\nand repair their forces by means of this rich fare of\neloquence, the young should not be kept too long at\nthese false semblances of reality, nor should they be\nallowed to become so familiar with these empty\nshadows that it is difficult for them to leave them\notherwise there is always the danger that, owing to\nthe seclusion in which they have almost grown\nold, they will shrink in terror from the real perils\nof public life, like men dazzled by the unfamiliar\nsunlight. Indeed it is recorded that this fate\nactually befell Marcus Porcius Latro, the first professor of rhetoric to make a name for himself; for\nwhen, at the height of his fame in the schools, he was\ncalled upon to plead a case in the forum, he put\nforward the most earnest request that the court\nshould be transferred to some public hall. He was\nso unaccustomed to speak in the open air that all his\neloquence seemed to reside within the compass of a roof and four walls. For this reason a young man\nwho has acquired a thorough knowledge from his\ninstructors of the methods of invention and style\nwhich is not by any means an endless task, if those\ninstructors have the knowledge and the will to\nteach, and who has also managed to obtain a\nreasonable amount of practice in the art, should\nfollow the custom in vogue with our ancestors, and\nselect some one orator to follow and imitate. He\nshould attend as many trials as possible and be a\nfrequent spectator of the conflicts in which he is\ndestined to take part. Next he should write out\nspeeches of his own dealing either with the cases\nwhich he has actually heard pleaded or with others,\nprovided always they be actual cases, and should\nargue them from both sides, training himself with\nthe real weapons of his warfare, just as gladiators do\nor as Brutus did in that speech in defence of Milo\nwhich I have already mentioned. This is better\nthan writing replies to old speeches, as Cestius did\nto Cicero's defence of Milo in spite of the fact that,\nhis knowledge being confined to what was said for\nthe defence, he could not have possessed sufficient\nacquaintance with the other side of the case. The young man, however, whom his instructor has\ncompelled to be as realistic as possible in declamation,\nand to deal with every class of subject, instead of\nmerely selecting the easiest and most attractive cases,\nas is done at present, will thus qualify himself much\nmore rapidly for actual forensic practice. Under existing circumstances the practice of the principle which\nI mentioned second is, as a rule, hampered by the\nlarge size of the classes and the practice of allotting\ncertain days for recitation, to which must be added the contributory circumstance that the boys' parents\nare more interested in the number of their sons'\nrecitations than their quality. But, as I think I said\nin the first book, the really good teacher will not\nburden himself with a larger number of pupils than\nhe can manage, and will prune any tendency to\nexcessive loquacity, limiting their remarks to the\nactual points involved by the subject of the declamation and forbidding them to range, as some would\nhave them do, over every subject in heaven and\nearth further, he will either extend the period\nwithin which he insists on their speaking, or will\npermit them to divide their themes into several\nportions. The thorough treatment of one theme\nwill be more profitable than the sketchy and superficial treatment of a number of subjects. For the\nlatter practice has the result that nothing is put in\nits proper place and that the opening of the declamation exceeds all reasonable bounds, since the\nyoung orator crams all the flowers of eloquence\nwhich belong to all the different portions of the\ntheme into that portion which he has to deliver,\nand fearing to lose what should naturally come later,\nintroduces wild confusion into the earlier portions\nof his speech. Having dealt with writing, the next point\nwhich claims our attention is premeditation, which\nitself derives force from the practice of writing and\nforms an intermediate stage between the labours of\nthe pen and the more precarious fortunes of improvisation; indeed I am not sure that it is not more\nfrequently of use than either. For there are places\nand occasions where writing is impossible, while both\nare available in abundance for premeditation. For but a few hours' thought will suffice to cover all the\npoints even of cases of importance; if we wake at\nnight, the very darkness will assist us, while even in\nthe midst of legal proceedings our mind will find\nsome vacant space for meditation, and will refuse to\nremain inactive. Again, this practice will not merely\nsecure the proper arrangement of our matter without\nany recourse to writing, which in itself is no small\nachievement, but will also set the words which we\nare going to use in their proper order, and bring the\ngeneral texture of our speech to such a stage of\ncompletion that nothing further is required beyond\nthe finishing touches. And as a rule the memory is\nmore retentive of thoughts when the attention has\nnot been relaxed by the fancied security which\nresults from committing them to writing. But the concentration which this requires cannot\nbe attained in a moment or even quickly. For, in\nthe first place, we must write much before we can\nform that ideal of style which must always be\npresent to our minds even when engaged in premeditation. Secondly, we must gradually acquire\nthe habit of thought to begin with, we shall content ourselves with covering but a few details, which\nour minds are capable of reproducing with accuracy;\nthen by advances so gradual that our labour is not\nsensibly increased we must develop our powers and\nconfirm them by frequent practice, a task in which\nthe most important part is played by the memory.\nFor this reason I must postpone some of my remarks\nto the portion of this work reserved for the treatment of that topic. At length, however, our powers\nwill have developed so far that the man who is not\nhampered by lack of natural ability will by dint of persistent study be enabled, when it comes to speaking, to rely no less on what he has thought out than\nwhat he has written out and learnt by heart. At\nany rate, Cicero records that Metrodorus of Scepsis,\nEmpylus of Rhodes, and our own Hortensius were\nable to reproduce what they had thought out word\nfor word when it came to actual pleading. If, however, some brilliant improvisation should\noccur to us while speaking, we must not cling superstitiously to our premeditated scheme. For premeditation is not so accurate as to leave no room\nfor happy inspiration even when writing we often\ninsert thoughts which occur to us on the spur of the\nmoment. Consequently this form of preparation\nmust be conceived on such lines that we shall find\nno difficulty either in departing from it or returning\nto it at will. For, although it is essential to bring\nwith us into court a supply of eloquence which has\nbeen prepared in advance in the study and on which\nwe can confidently rely, there is no greater folly\nthan the rejection of the gifts of the moment.\nTherefore our premeditation should be such that\nfortune may never be able to fool us, but may, on\nthe contrary, be able to assist us. This end will be\nobtained by developing the power of memory so\nthat our conceptions may flow from us without fear\nof disaster, and that we may be enabled to look\nahead without anxious backward glances or the\nfeeling that we are absolutely dependent on what\nwe can call to mind. Otherwise I prefer the rashness of improvisation to the coherence given by\npremeditation. For such backward glances place us\nat a disadvantage, because our search for our premeditated ideas makes us miss others, and we draw our matter from our memory rather than from the\nsubject on which we are speaking. And even if we\nare to rely on our memory and our subject alike,\nthere are more things that may be discovered than\never yet have been. But the crown of all our study and the\nhighest reward of our long labours is the power of\nimprovisation. The man who fails to acquire this\nhad better, in my opinion, abandon the task of\nadvocacy and devote his powers of writing to other\nbranches of literature. For it is scarcely decent for\nan honourable man to promise assistance to the\npublic at large which he may be unable to provide in\nthe most serious emergencies, or to attempt to enter\na harbour which his ship cannot hope to make save\nwhen sailing before a gentle breeze. For there are\ncountless occasions when the sudden necessity may be\nimposed upon him of speaking without preparation\nbefore the magistrates or in a trial which comes on\nunexpectedly. And if any such sudden emergency\nbefalls, I will not say any innocent citizen, but some\none of the orator's friends or connexions, is he to\nstand tongue-tied and, in answer to those who seek\nsalvation in his eloquence and are doomed, unless\nthey secure assistance, to ask for delay of proceedings and time for silent and secluded study, till such\nmoment as he can piece together the words that fail\nhim, commit them to memory and prepare his voice\nand lungs for the effort What theory of the duties\nof an orator is there which permits him to ignore\nsuch sudden issues What will happen when he\nhas to reply to his opponent For often the expected arguments to which we have written a reply\nfail us and the whole aspect of the case undergoes a sudden change; consequently the variation to\nwhich cases are liable makes it as necessary for us\nto change our methods as it is for a pilot to change\nhis course before the oncoming storm. Again, what\nuse is much writing, assiduous reading and long\nyears of study, if the difficulty is to remain as great\nas it was in the beginning The man who is always\nfaced with the same labour can only confess that his\npast labour has been spent in vain. I do not ask\nhim to prefer to speak extempore, but merely that\nlie should be able to do so. And this capacity is\nbest acquired by the following method. In the first place, we must note the direction which\nthe argument is likely to take, since we cannot run\nour race unless we know the goal and the course.\nIt is not enough to know what are the parts into\nwhich forensic pleadings are divided or the principles determining the order of the various questions,\nimportant though these points are. We must realise\nwhat should come first, second, and so on, in the\nseveral parts; for these points are so closely linked\ntogether by the very nature of things that they\ncannot be separated, nor their order changed, without giving rise to confusion. The orator, who speaks\nmethodically, will above all take the actual sequence\nof the various points as his guide, and it is for this\nreason that even but moderately trained speakers\nfind it easiest to keep the natural order in the statement of facts. Secondly, the orator must know\nwhat to look for in each portion of his case he\nmust not beat about the bush or allow himself to be\nthrown off the track by thoughts which suggest\nthemselves from irrelevant quarters, or produce a\nspeech which is a confused mass of incongruities, owing to his habit of leaping this way and that, and\nnever sticking to any one point. Finally, he must\nconfine himself to certain definite bounds, and for\nthis division is absolutely necessary. When to the\nbest of his ability he has dealt fully with all the\npoints which he has advanced, he will know that he\nhas reached his goal. The precepts just given are dependent on theory.\nThose to which I now come depend on individual\nstudy. We must acquire a store of the best words\nand phrases on lines that I have already laid down,\nwhile our style must be formed by continuous and\nconscientious practice in writing, so that even our\nimprovisations may reproduce the tone of our writing,\nand after writing much, we must give ourselves\nfrequent practice in speaking. For facility is mainly\nthe result of habit and exercise and, if it be\nlost only for a brief time, the result will be\nnot merely that we fall short of the requisite\nrapidity, but that our lips will become clogged\nand slow to open. For although we need to\npossess a certain natural nimbleness of mind to\nenable us, while we are saying what the instant\ndemands, to build up what is to follow and to\nsecure that there will always be some thought formed\nand conceived in advance ready to serve our voice,\nnone the less, it is scarcely possible either for natural\ngifts or for methodic art to enable the mind to\ngrapple simultaneously with such manifold duties,\nand to be equal at one and the same time to the\ntasks of invention, arrangement, and style, together\nwith what we are uttering at the moment, what we\nhave got to say next and what we have to look to\nstill further on, not to mention the fact that it is necessary all the time to give close attention to\nvoice, delivery and gesture. For our mental activities\nmust range far ahead and pursue the ideas which\nare still in front, and in proportion as the speaker\npays out what he has in hand, he must make advances\nto himself from his reserve funds, in order that, until\nwe reach our conclusion, our mind's eye may urge\nits gaze forward, keeping time with our advance\notherwise we shall halt and stumble, and pour forth\nshort and broken phrases, like persons who can only\ngasp out what they have to say. There is, therefore, a certain mechanical knack,\nwhich the Greeks call which enables\nthe hand to go on scribbling, while the eye takes\nin whole lines at once as it reads, observes the intonations and the stops, and sees what is coming\nbefore the reader has articulated to himself what\nprecedes. It is a similar knack which makes possible\nthose miraculous tricks which we see jugglers and\nmasters of sleight of hand perform upon the stage,\nin such a manner that the spectator can scarcely\nhelp believing that the objects which they throw\ninto the air come to hand of their own accord, and\nrun where they are bidden. But this knack will\nonly be of real service if it be preceded by the art\nof which we have spoken, so that what is irrational\nin itself will nevertheless be founded on reason. For\nunless a man speaks in an orderly, ornate and fluent\nmanner, I refuse to dignify his utterance with the\nname of speech, but consider it the merest rant.\nNor again shall I ever be induced to admire a continuous flow of random talk, such as I note streams in\ntorrents even from the lips of women when they\nquarrel, although, if a speaker is swept away by warmth of feeling and genuine inspiration, it frequently happens that he attains a success from improvisation which would have been beyond the reach of\nthe most careful preparation. When this occurred, the\nold orators, such as Cicero, used to say that some god\nhad inspired the speaker. But the reason is obvious.\nFor profound emotion and vivid imagination sweep\non with unbroken force, whereas, if retarded by the\nslowness of the pen, they are liable to grow cold and,\nit put off for the moment, may never return. Above\nall, if we add to these obstacles an unhealthy tendency\nto quibble over the choice of words, and check our\nadvance at each step, the vehemence of our onset\nloses its impetus; while even though our choice of\nindividual words may be of the happiest, the style\nwill be a mere patchwork with no regular pattern. Consequently those vivid conceptions of which I\nspoke and which, as I remarked, are called together with everything that we intend to say,\nthe persons and questions involved, and the hopes\nand fears to which they give rise, must be kept\nclearly before our eyes and admitted to our hearts\nfor it is feeling and force of imagination that make\nus eloquent. It is for this reason that even the uneducated have no difficulty in finding words to express\ntheir meaning, if only they are stirred by some strong\nemotion. Further the attention of the mind must be\ndirected not to some one thing, but simultaneously to\na number of things in continuous sequence. The\nresult will be the same as when we cast our eyes\nalong some straight road and see at once all that is on\nand near it, obtaining a view not merely of its end,\nbut of the whole way there. Dread of the shame\nof failure is also a powerful stimulant to oratory, and it may be regarded as a matter for wonder that,\nwhereas when writing we delight in privacy and\nshrink from the presence of witnesses, in extempore\npleading a large audience has an encouraging effect,\nlike that which the sight of the massed standards\nhas on the soldier. For the sheer necessity of speaking thrusts forward and forces out our labouring\nthought, and the desire to win approbation kindles\nand fosters our efforts. So true is it that there is\nnothing which does not look for some reward, that\neloquence, despite the fact that its activity is in itself\nproductive of a strong feeling of pleasure, is influenced\nby nothing so much as the immediate acquisition of\npraise and renown. Nor should any man put such\ntrust in his native ability as to hope that this power\nwill present itself to him at the outset of his career\nas an orator; for the precepts which I laid down for\npremeditation apply to improvisation also; we\nmust develop it by gradual stages from small beginnings, until we have reached that perfection which\ncan only be produced and maintained by practice. Moreover, the orator should reach such a pitch of\nexcellence that, while premeditation may still be the\nsafer method, it will not necessarily be the better,\nsince many have acquired the gift of improvisation not\nmerely in prose, but in verse as well, as, for example,\nAntipater of Sidon and Licinius Archias for whose\npowers we have the unquestionable authority of\nCicero, not to mention the fact that there are\nmany, even in our own day, who have done this and\nare still doing it. I do not, however, regard this\naccomplishment as being particularly valuable in\nitself, for it is both unpractical and unnecessary, but\nmention it as a useful example to encourage students training for the bar, in the hope that they may be\nable to acquire this accomplishment. Still our confidence in our power of speaking extempore should\nnever be so great that we should neglect to devote\na few minutes to the consideration of what we are\ngoing to say. There will but rarely be occasions\nwhen this is impossible, while in the lawsuits of\nthe courts there is always some time allowed for the\npurpose. For no one can plead a cause with the\nfacts of which be is unacquainted. Some declaimers,\nit is true, are led by a perverse ambition to attempt\nto speak the moment their theme has been given\nthem, and even ask for a word with which to start,\nan affectation which is in the worst and most\ntheatrical taste. But eloquence has, in her turn,\nnothing but derision for those that insult her thus,\nand speakers who wish to seem learned to fools are\nmerely regarded as fools by the learned. If, however, chance should impose the necessity upon us of\npleading a case at such short notice, we shall require\nto develop special mental agility, to give all our\nattention to the subject, and to make a temporary\nsacrifice of our care for the niceties of language, if\nwe find it impossible to secure both. On such\noccasions a slower delivery and a style of speaking suggestive of a certain indecision and doubt will\nsecure us time to think, but we must be careful to\ndo this in such a way as to give the impression of\nthought, not of hesitation. This precaution may be\nemployed while we are clearing harbour, if the wind\ndrive us forward before all our tackle is ready.\nAfterwards, as we proceed upon our course, we shall\ntrim our sails, arrange our ropes, and pray that\nthe breeze may fill our sails. Such a procedure is preferable to yielding ourselves to an empty torrent\nof words, that the storm may sweep us where it will. But it requires no less careful study to maintain\nthan to acquire this facility. Theory once mastered\nis not forgotten, and the pen loses but little of its\nspeed by disuse but this promptitude and readiness\nfor action can be maintained by practice only. The\nbest form of exercise is to speak daily before an\naudience of several persons, who should, as far as\npossible, be selected from those whose judgement\nand good opinion we value, since it is rare for anyone to be sufficiently critical of himself. It is even\nbetter to speak alone than not at all. There is yet\nanother method of exercising this faculty it consists\nin going over our subjects in their entirety in silent\nthought, although we must all the time formulate\nthe words to ourselves such practice is possible at\nany moment or place that finds us unoccupied, and\nis, in some respects, more useful than that which I\nhave just mentioned; for we are more careful about\nour composition than when we are actually speaking\nand in momentary fear of interrupting the continuous\nflow of our language. On the other hand, the first\nmethod is more valuable for certain purposes, as it\ngives strength to our voice, fluency to our tongue\nand vigour to our gesture; and the latter, as I have\nalready remarked, in itself excites the orator and\nspurs him on, as he waves his hand or stamps his\nfoot he is, in fact, like the lion, that is said to lash\nhimself to fury with his tail. But we must study\nalways and everywhere. For there is scarce a single\nday in our lives that is so full of occupations that we\nmay not, at some moment or other, snatch a few\nprecious minutes, as Cicero records that Brutus was wont to do, either for writing or reading or speaking;\nGaius Carbo, for example, was in the habit of indulging in such exercises even in his tent. I must also\nmention the precept which again has the approval\nof Cicero that we should never be careless about\nour language. Whatever we say, under whatever\ncircumstances, should be perfect in its way. As regards writing, this is certainly never more necessary\nthan when we have frequently to speak extempore.\nFor it maintains the solidity of our speech and gives\ndepth to superficial facility. We may compare the\npractice of husbandmen who cut away the uppermost\nroots of their vines, which run close to the surface of\nthe soil, that the taproots may strike deeper and gain\nin strength. Indeed I am not sure that, if we practise both with care and assiduity, mutual profit will\nnot result, and writing will give us greater precision\nof speech, while speaking will make us write with\ngreater facility. We must write, therefore, whenever possible; if we cannot write, we must meditate\nif both are out of the question, we must still speak in\nsuch a manner that we shall not seem to be taken\nunawares nor our client to be left in the lurch. It is, however, a common practice with those who\nhave many cases to plead to write out the most\nnecessary portions, more especially the beginnings of\ntheir speeches, to cover the remainder of that which\nthey are able to prepare by careful premeditation\nand to trust to improvisation in emergency, a practice regularly adopted by Cicero, as is clear from his\nnote-books. But the notes of other orators are also\nin circulation; some have been discovered by\nchance, just as they were jotted down previous to a\nspeech, while others have been edited in book form, as in the case of the speeches delivered in the courts\nby Servius Sulpicius, of whose works only three\nspeeches survive. These memoranda, however, of\nwhich I am speaking are so carefully drawn up that\nthey seem to me to have been composed by himself\nfor the benefit of posterity. But Cicero's notes were\noriginally intended merely to meet the requirements\nof the moment, and were afterwards collected by\nTiro. In making this apology I do not mean to\nimply that I disapprove of them, but merely wish\nto make them more worthy of admiration. And in\nthis connexion I must state that I admit the use of\nbrief memoranda and note-books, which may even be\nheld in the hand and referred to from time to time.\nBut I disapprove of the advice given by Laenas, that\nwe should set down in our note-books, duly tabulated under the appropriate headings, summaries of\nwhat we propose to say, even in cases where we\nhave already written it out in full. For reliance on\nsuch notes as these makes us careless in learning\nwhat we have written and mutilates and deforms our\nstyle. For my own part I think that we should\nnever write out anything which we do not intend to\ncommit to memory. For if we do, our thoughts will\nrun back to what we have elaborated in writing and\nwill not permit us to try the fortune of the moment.\nConsequently, the mind will waver in doubt between\nthe two alternatives, having forgotten what was\ncommitted to writing and being unable to think of\nanything fresh to say. However, as the topic of\nmemory will be discussed in the next book, I will\nnot introduce it here, as there are other points\nwhich require to be dealt with first. After acquiring the power of writing and thinking, as described in the preceding book, and also of\npleading extempore, if occasion demand, our next\ntask will be to ensure that appropriateness of speech,\nwhich Cicero shows to be the fourth department of\nstyle, and which is, in my opinion, highly necessary.\nFor since the ornaments of style are varied and\nmanifold and suited for different purposes, they will,\nunless adapted to the matter and the persons concerned, not merely fail to give our style distinction,\nbut will even destroy its effect and produce a result\nquite the reverse of that which our matter should\nproduce. For what profit is it that our words should\nbe Latin, significant and graceful, and be further\nembellished with elaborate figures and rhythms,\nunless all these qualities are in harmony with the\nviews to which we seek to lead the judge and mould\nhis opinions What use is it if we employ a lofty\ntone in cases of trivial import, a slight and refined\nstyle in cases of great moment, a cheerful tone when\nour matter calls for sadness, a gentle tone when it\ndemands vehemence, threatening language when\nsupplication, and submissive when energy is required, or fierceness and violence when our theme is\none that asks for charm Such incongruities are as\nunbecoming as it is for men to wear necklaces and\npearls and flowing raiment which are the natural\nadornments of women, or for women to robe themselves in the garb of triumph, than which there can\nbe conceived no more majestic raiment. This topic\nis discussed by Cicero in the third book of the de\nOratore, and, although he touches on it but lightly,\nhe really covers the whole subject when he says,\nOne single style of oratory is not suited to every case, nor\nto every audience, nor every speaker, nor every occasion.\nAnd he says the same at scarcely greater length in\nthe Orator. But in the first of these works Lucius\nCrassus, since he is speaking in the presence of men\ndistinguished alike for their learning and their eloquence, thinks it sufficient merely to indicate this topic\nto his audience for their recognition; while in the\nlatter work Cicero asserts that, as these facts are\nfamiliar to Brutus, to whom that treatise is addressed,\nthey will be given briefer treatment, despite the fact\nthat the subject is a wide one and is discussed at\ngreater length by the philosophers. 1, on the other\nhand, have undertaken the education of an orator,\nand, consequently, am speaking not merely to those\nthat know, but also to learners; I shall, therefore,\nhave some claim to forgiveness if I discuss the topic\nin greater detail. For this reason, it is of the first importance that\nwe should know what style is most suitable for conciliating, instructing or moving the judge, and what\neffects we should aim at in different parts of our\nspeech. Thus we shall eschew antique, metaphorical and newly-coined words in our exordium, statement of facts and arguments, as we shall avoid flowing\nperiods woven with elaborate grace, when the case\nhas to be divided and distinguished under its various\nheads, while, on the other hand, we shall not employ\nmean or colloquial language, devoid of all artistic structure, in the peroration, nor, when the theme calls\nfor compassion, attempt to dry the tears of our audience with jests. For all ornament derives its effect\nnot from its own qualities so much as from the\ncircumstances in which it is applied, and the occasion\nchosen for saying anything is at least as important a\nconsideration as what is actually said. But the whole\nof this question of appropriate language turns on\nsomething more than our choice of style, for it has\nmuch in common with invention. For if words can\nproduce such an impression, how much greater must\nthat be which is created by the facts themselves.\nBut I have already laid down rules for the treatment\nof the latter in various portions of this work. Too much insistence cannot be laid upon the point\nthat no one can be said to speak appropriately who\nhas not considered not merely what it is expedient,\nbut also what it is becoming to say. I am well\naware that these two considerations generally go\nhand in hand. For whatever is becoming is, as a\nrule, useful, and there is nothing that does more to\nconciliate the good-will of the judge than the\nobservance or to alienate it than the disregard of\nthese considerations. Sometimes, however, the two\nare at variance. Now, whenever this occurs, expediency must yield to the demands of what is\nbecoming. Who is there who does not realise that\nnothing would have contributed more to secure the\nacquittal of Socrates than if he had employed the\nordinary forensic methods of defence and had\nconciliated the minds of his judges by adopting a\nsubmissive tone and had devoted his attention to\nrefuting the actual charge against him But such\na course would have been unworthy of his character, and, therefore, he pleaded as one who would account\nthe penalty to which he might be sentenced as the\nhighest of honours. The wisest of men preferred to\nsacrifice the remnant of his days rather than to cancel\nall his past life. And since he was but ill understood by the men of his own day, he reserved his\ncase for the approval of posterity and at the cost of\na few last declining years achieved through all the\nages life everlasting. And so although Lysias, who\nwas accounted the first orator of that time, offered\nhim a written defence, he refused to make use of\nit, since, though he recognised its excellence, he\nregarded it as unbecoming to himself. This instance alone shows that the end which the orator\nmust keep in view is not persuasion, but speaking\nwell, since there are occasions when to persuade\nwould be a blot upon his honour. The line adopted\nby Socrates was useless to secure his acquittal, but\nwas of real service to him as a man; and that is by\nfar the greater consideration. In drawing this distinction between what is expedient and what is\nbecoming, I have followed rather the usage of common speech than the strict law of truth; unless,\nindeed, the elder Africanus is to be regarded as\nhaving failed to consult his true interests, when he\nretired into exile sooner than wrangle over his own\ninnocence with a contemptible tribune of the people,\nor unless it be alleged that Publius Rutilius was\nignorant of his true advantage both on the occasion\nwhen he adopted a defence which may almost be\ncompared with that of Socrates, and when he preferred to remain in exile rather than return at Sulla's\nbidding. No, these great men regarded all those\ntrifles that the most abject natures regard as advantageous, as being contemptible if weighed in the\nbalance with virtue, and for this reason they have\ntheir reward in the deathless praise of all generations. Let not us, then, be so poor spirited as to\nregard the acts, which we extol, as being inexpedient.\nHowever, it is but rarely that this distinction, such\nas it is, is called into play. As I have said, the\nexpedient and the becoming will, as a rule, be\nidentical in every kind of case. Still, there are two\nthings which will be becoming to all men at all times\nand in all places, namely, to act and speak as befits a\nman of honour, and it will never at any time beseem\nany man to speak or act dishonourably. On the\nother hand, things of minor importance and occupying something like a middle position between the\ntwo are generally of such a nature that they may be\nconceded to some, but not to others, while it will\ndepend on the character of the speaker and the\ncircumstances of time, place and motive whether we\nregard them as more or less excusable or reprehensible. When, however, we are speaking of our\nown affairs or those of others, we must distinguish\nbetween the expedient and the becoming, while\nrecognising that the majority of the points which\nwe have to consider will fall under neither head. In the first place, then, all kinds of boasting are a\nmistake, above all, it is an error for an orator to praise\nhis own eloquence, and, further, not merely wearies,\nbut in the majority of cases disgusts the audience.\nFor there is ever in the mind of man a certain\nelement of lofty and unbending pride that will not\nbrook superiority and for this reason we take delight in raising the humble and submissive to their\nfeet, since such an act gives us a consciousness of our superiority, and as soon as all sense of rivalry disappears, its place is taken by a feeling of humanity.\nBut the man who exalts himself beyond reason is\nlooked upon as depreciating and showing a contempt\nfor others and as making them seem small rather\nthan himself seem great. As a result, those who are\nbeneath him feel a grudge against him for those who\nare unwilling to yield and yet have not the strength\nto hold their own are always liable to this failing,\nwhile his superiors laugh at him and the good\ndisapprove. Indeed, as a rule, you will find that\narrogance implies a false self-esteem, whereas those\nwho possess true merit find satisfaction enough in\nthe consciousness of possession. Cicero has been severely censured in this connexion, although he was far more given to boasting\nof his political achievements than of his eloquence,\nat any rate, in his speeches. And as a rule he had\nsome sound reason for his self-praise. For he was\neither defending those who had assisted him to crush\nthe conspiracy of Catiline, or was replying to attacks\nmade upon him by those who envied his position;\nattacks which he was so far unable to withstand\nthat he suffered exile as the penalty for having\nsaved his country. Consequently, we may regard\nhis frequent reference to the deeds accomplished\nin his consulship as being due quite as much to the\nnecessities of defence as to the promptings of vainglory. As regards his own eloquence, he never\nmade immoderate claims for it in his pleading, while\nhe always paid a handsome tribute to the eloquence\nof the advocate, who opposed him. For example,\nthere are passages such as the following and, Again, in his speech against\nCaecilius on the selection of an accuser for Verres,\ndespite the fact that the question as to which was\nthe most capable pleader, was a factor of great\nimportance, he rather depreciated his opponent's\neloquence than exalted his own, and asserted that\nhe had done all in his power to make himself an\norator, though he knew he had not succeeded. In\nhis letters to intimate friends, it is true, and occasionally in his dialogues, he tells the truth of his own\neloquence, though in the latter case he is careful\nalways to place the remarks in question in the\nmouth of some other character. And yet I am not\nsure that open boasting is not more tolerable, owing\nto its sheer straightforwardness, than that perverted\nform of self-praise, which makes the millionaire say\nthat he is not a poor man, the man of mark describe\nhimself as obscure, the powerful pose as weak,\nand the eloquent as unskilled and even inarticulate.\nBut the most ostentatious kind of boasting takes\nthe form of actual self-derision. Let us therefore\nleave it to others to praise us. For it beseems us,\nas Demosthenes says, to blush even when we are\npraised by others. I do not mean to deny that\nthere are occasions when an orator may speak of\nhis own achievements, as Demosthenes himself does\nin his defence of Ctesiphon. But on that occasion\nhe qualified his statements in such a way as to show\nthat he was compelled by necessity to do so, and to\nthrow the odium attaching to such a proceeding on\nthe man who had forced him to it. Again, Cicero\noften speaks of his suppression of the Catilinarian\nconspiracy, but either attributes his success to the courage shown by the senate or to the providence of\nthe immortal gods. If he puts forward stronger claims\nto merit, it is generally when speaking against his\nenemies and detractors; for he was bound to defend\nhis actions when they were denounced as discreditable. One could only wish that he had shown\ngreater restraint in his poems, which those who love\nhim not are never weary of criticising. I refer to\npassages such as or together with that and the\n;\nextravagances which he permitted himself in imitation of certain precedents in Greek literature. But while it is unseemly to make a boast of one's\neloquence, it is, however, at times permissible to\nexpress confidence in it. Who, for instance, can\nblame the following And a little later he speaks yet more openly Another form of arrogance is displayed by those who\ndeclare that they have come to a clear conviction of the justice of their cause, which they would not\notherwise have undertaken. For the judges give\nbut a reluctant hearing to such as presume to\nanticipate their verdict, and the orator cannot hope\nthat his opponents will regard his ipse dixit with the\nveneration accorded by the Pythagoreans to that of\ntheir master. But this fault will vary in seriousness\naccording to the character of the orator who uses\nsuch language. For such assertions may to some\nextent be justified by the age, rank, and authority\nof the speaker. But scarcely any orator is possessed\nof these advantages to such an extent as to exempt\nhim from the duty of tempering such assertions by\na certain show of modesty, a remark which also\napplies to all passages in which the advocate draws\nany of his arguments from his own person. What\ncould have been more presumptuous than if Cicero\nhad asserted that the fact that a man was the son\nof a Roman knight should never be regarded as a\nserious charge, in a case in which he was appearing\nfor the defence But he succeeded in giving this\nvery argument a favourable turn by associating his\nown rank with that of the judges, and saying, An impudent, disorderly, or angry tone is always\nunseemly, no matter who it be that assumes it; and\nit becomes all the more reprehensible in proportion\nto the age, rank, and experience of the speaker.\nBut we are familiar with the sight of certain brawling advocates who are restrained neither by respect\nfor the court nor by the recognised methods and manners of pleading. The obvious inference from\nthis attitude of mind is that they are utterly reckless\nboth in undertaking cases and in pleading them.\nFor a man's character is generally revealed and the\nsecrets of his heart are laid bare by his manner of speaking, and there is good ground for the Greek aphorism\nthat, The following vices are of a meaner type grovelling flattery,\naffected buffoonery, immodesty in dealing with things\nor words which are unseemly or obscene, and disregard of authority on all and every occasion. They\nare faults which, as a rule, are found in those who\nare over-anxious either to please or amuse. Again, different kinds of eloquence suit different\nspeakers. For example, a full, haughty, bold and\nflorid style would be less becoming to an old man\nthan that restrained, mild and precise style to which\nCicero refers, when he says that his style is beginning\nto grow grey-haired. It is the same with their style\nas their clothes; purple and scarlet raiment goes ill\nwith grey hairs. In the young, however, we can\nendure a rich and even, perhaps, a risky style. On\nthe other hand, a dry, careful and compressed style\nis unpleasing in the young as suggesting the affectation of severity, since even the authority of character\nthat goes with age is considered as premature in\nyoung men. Soldiers are best suited by a simple\nstyle. Those, again, who make ostentatious profession, as some do, of being philosophers, would do\nwell to avoid most of the ornaments of oratory, more\nespecially those which consist in appeals to the\npassions, which they regard as moral blemishes. So,\ntoo, the employment of rare words and of rhythmical\nstructure are incongruous with their profession. For their beards and gloomy brows are ill-suited not\nmerely to luxuriance of style, such as we find in\nCicero's but even to full-blooded passages as, But the public man, who is truly\nwise and devotes himself not to idle disputations,\nbut to the administration of the state, from which\nthose who call themselves philosophers have withdrawn themselves afar, will gladly employ every\nmethod that may contribute to the end which he\nseeks to gain by his eloquence, although he will first\nform a clear conception in his mind as to what aims\nare honourable and what are not. There is a form\nof eloquence which is becoming in the greatest\nmen, but inadmissible in others. For example, the\nmethods of eloquence employed by commanders and\nconquerors in their hour of triumph are to a great\nextent to be regarded as in a class apart. The\ncomparison of the eloquence of Plompey and Cato\nthe younger, who slew himself in the civil war, will\nillustrate my meaning. The former was extraordinarily eloquent in the description of his own\nexploits, while the latter's powers were displayed\nin debates in the senate. Again, the same remark\nwill seem freedom of speech in one's mouth, madness\nin another's, and arrogance in a third. We laugh at\nthe words used by Thersites to Agamemnon; but\nput them in the mouth of Diomede or some other\nof his peers, and they will seem the expression of a\ngreat spirit. said\nLucius Crassus to Phililppus, That was honourable\nfreedom of speech, and yet we should not tolerate\nsuch words from everybody's lips. One of the poets\nsays that he does not care whether Caesar be white\nor black. That is madness. But reverse the case.\nSuppose that Caesar said it of the poet That\nwould be arrogance. The tragic and comic poets\npay special attention to character, since they introduce a great number and variety of persons. Those\nwho wrote speeches for others paid a like attention\nto these points, and so do the declaimers; for we do\nnot always speak as advocates, but frequently as\nactual parties to the suit. But even in these cases in which we appear as\nadvocates, differences of character require careful\nobservation. For we introduce fictitious personages\nand speak through other's lips, and we must therefore\nallot the appropriate character to those to whom\nwe lend a voice. For example, Publius Clodius will\nbe represented in one way, Appius Caecus in\nanother, while Caecilius makes the father in his\ncomedy speak in quite a different manner from the\nfather in the comedy of Terence. What can be\nmore brutal than the words of Verres' lictor,  or braver than\nthose of the man from whom the scourge could\nwring but one cry, Again, read the words which Cicero places in the\nmouth of Milo in his peroration are they not\nworthy of the man who to save the state had so\noft repressed a seditious citizen, and had triumphed\nby his valour over the ambush that was laid for\nhim Further, it is not merely true that the\nvariety required in impersonation will be in proportion to the variety presented by the case, for\nimpersonation demands even greater variety, since\nit involves the portrayal of the emotions of children,\nwomen, nations, and even of voiceless things, all\nof which require to be represented in character.\nThe same points have to be observed with respect\nto those for whom we plead for our tone will vary\nwith the character of our client, according as he is\ndistinguished, or of humble position, popular or the\nreverse, while we must also take into account the\ndifferences in their principles and their past life.\nAs regards the orator himself, the qualities which\nwill most commend him are courtesy, kindliness,\nmoderation and benevolence. But, on the other\nhand, the opposite of these qualities will sometimes\nbe becoming to a good man. He may hate the bad,\nbe moved to passion in the public interest, seek to\navenge crime and wrong, and, in fine, as I said at\nthe beginning, may follow the promptings of every\nhonourable emotion. The character of the speaker and of the person on\nwhose behalf he speaks are, however, not the only\npoints which it is important to take into account\nthe character of those before whom we have to\nspeak calls for serious consideration. Their power\nand rank will make no small difference; we shall\nemploy different methods according as we are speaking before the emperor, a magistrate, a senator, a\nprivate citizen, or merely a free man, while a\ndifferent tone is demanded by trials in the public\ncourts, and in cases submitted to arbitration. For\nwhile a display of care and anxiety, and the employment of every device available for the amplification of our style are becoming when we are pleading for a client accused on a capital charge,\nit would be useless to employ the same methods in\ncases and trials of minor importance, and the speaker\nwho, when speaking from his chair before an arbitrator\non some trivial question, should make an admission\nlike that made by Cicero, to the effect that it was\nnot merely his soul that was in a state of commotion, but that his whole body was convulsed with\nshuddering, would meet with well-deserved ridicule.\nAgain, who does not know what different styles of\neloquence are required when speaking before the\ngrave assembly of the senate and before the fickle\npopulace, since even when we are pleading before\nsingle judges the same style will not be suitable\nfor use before one of weighty character and another\nof a more frivolous disposition, while a learned judge\nmust not be addressed in the same tone that we\nshould employ before a soldier or a rustic, and our\nstyle must at times be lowered and simplified, for\nfear that he may be unable to take it in or to\nunderstand it. Again, circumstances of time and place demand\nspecial consideration. The occasion may be one\nfor sorrow or for rejoicing, the time at our disposal\nmay be ample or restricted, and the orator must\nadapt himself to all these circumstances. It, likewise, makes no small difference whether we are\nspeaking in public or in private, before a crowded\naudience or in comparative seclusion, in another\ncity or our own, in the camp or in the forum each\nof these places will require its own style and peculiar\nform of oratory, since even in other spheres of life\nthe same actions are not equally suited to the forum,\nthe senate-house, the Campus Martius, the theatre or one's own house, and there is much that is not\nin itself reprehensible, and may at times be absolutely necessary, which will be regarded as unseemly\nif done in some place where it is not sanctioned by\ncustom. I have already pointed out how much\nmore elegance and ornament is allowed by the\ntopics of demonstrative oratory, whose main object\nis the delectation of the audience, than is permitted\nby deliberative or forensic themes which are concerned with action and argument. To this must be added the fact that certain\nqualities, which are in themselves merits of a high\norder, may be rendered unbecoming by the special\ncircumstances of the case. For example, when a\nman is accused on a capital charge, and, above all,\nif he is defending himself before his conqueror or\nhis sovereign, it would be quite intolerable for him\nto indulge in frequent metaphors, antique or newlycoined words, rhythms as far removed as possible\nfrom the practice of every-day speech, rounded\nperiods, florid commonplaces and ornate reflexions.\nWould not all these devices destroy the impression\nof anxiety which should be created by a man in\nsuch peril, and rob him of the succour of pity, on\nwhich even the innocent are forced to rely Would\nany man be moved by the sad plight of one who\nrevealed himself as a vainglorious boaster, and\nostentatiously flaunted the airs and graces of his\neloquence at a moment when his fate hung in\nsuspense Would he not rather hate the man who,\ndespite his position as accused, hunted for fine\nwords, showed himself concerned for his reputation\nas a clever speaker, and found time at such a\nmoment to display his eloquence I consider that Marcus Caelius, in the speech in which he defended\nhimself against a charge of breach of the peace, showed\na wonderful grasp of these facts, when he said But there are some cases where the\nsuccess of the pleader depends on apology, entreaties\nfor mercy, or confession of error. Can sorrow be\nexpressed in epigram Or will enthymemes or\nepiphonemata avail to win the judge's mercy Will\nnot all embellishment of pure emotion merely impair its force and dispel compassion by such a display\nof apparent unconcern Or, suppose that a father\nhas to speak of his son's death, or of some wrong\nthat is worse than death, will he, in making his statement of facts, seek to achieve that grace in exposition which is secured by purity and lucidity of\nlanguage, and content himself with setting forth\nhis case in due order with brevity and meaning\nOr will he count over the heads of his argument\nupon his fingers, aim at niceties of division and\nproposition, and speak without the least energy of\nfeeling as is usual in such portions of a speech\nWhither will his grief have fled while he is thus\nengaged Where has the fountain of his tears been\nstayed How came this callous attention to the\nrules of text-books to obtrude itself Will he not\nrather, from his opening words to the very last he\nutters, maintain a continuous voice of lamentation\nand a mien of unvaried woe, if he desires to transplant his grief to the hearts of his audience For\nif he once remits aught of his passion of grief, he will never be able to recall it to the hearts of them\nthat hear him. This is a point which declaimers,\nabove all, must be careful to bear in mind I\nmention this because I have no compunction in\nreferring to a branch of the art which was once also\nmy own, or in reverting to the consideration of the\nyouthful students such as once were in my charge\nthe declaimer, I repeat, must bear this in mind,\nsince in the schools we often feign emotions that\naffect us not as advocates, but as the actual sufferers.\nFor example, we even imagine cases where persons,\neither because of some overwhelming misfortune or\nrepentance for some sin, demand from the senate the\nright to make an end of their lives; and in these\ncases it is obviously unbecoming not merely to adopt\na chanting intonation, a fault which has also become\nalmost universal, or to use extravagant language,\nbut even to argue without an admixture of emotional\nappeal, so managed as to be even more prominent\nthan the proof which is advanced. For the man\nwho can lay aside his grief for a moment while he\nis pleading, seems capable even of laying it aside\naltogether I am not sure, however, that it is not in our\nattitude towards our opponents that this care for\ndecorum, which we are now discussing, should be\nmost rigorously maintained. For there can be no\ndoubt, that in all accusations our first aim should\nbe to give the impression that it is only with the\ngreatest reluctance that we have consented to undertake the role of accuser. Consequently, I strongly\ndisapprove of such remarks as the following which\nwas made by Cassius Severus For,\nafter this, it is impossible to suppose that he had\njust or necessary reasons for accusing Asprenas, and\nwe cannot help suspecting that his motive was sheer\ndelight in accusation. But, beside this consideration, which applies to all cases, there is the further\npoint that certain cases demand special moderation.\nTherefore, a man who demands the appointment of\na curator for his father's property, should express his\ngrief at his father's affliction; and, however grave be\nthe charges that a father may be going to bring\nagainst his son, he should emphasize the painful\nnature of the necessity that is imposed upon him.\nAnd this he should do not merely in a few brief\nwords, but his emotion should colour his whole\nspeech, so that it may be felt not merely that he\nis speaking, but that he is speaking the truth.\nAgain, if a ward make allegations against his\nguardian, the latter must never give way to such\nanger that no trace is left of his former love or\nof a certain reverent regard for the memory of his\nopponent's father. I have already spoken, in the\nseventh book, I think, of the way in which a case\nshould be pleaded against a father who disinherits\nhis son, or a wife who brings a charge of illtreatment against her husband, while the fourth book,\nin which I prescribed certain rules for the exordium,\ncontains my instructions as to when it is becoming\nthat the parties should speak themselves, and when\nthey should employ an advocate to speak for them. It will be readily admitted by everyone that\nwords may be becoming or offensive in themselves.\nThere is therefore a further point, which presents\nthe most serious difficulty, that requires notice in this connexion we must consider by what means\nthings which are naturally unseemly and which, had\nwe been given the choice, we should have preferred\nnot to say, may be uttered without indecorum.\nWhat at first sight can be more unpleasing and what\nmore revolting to the ears of men than a case in\nwhich a son or his advocate has to speak against his\nmother And yet sometimes it is absolutely necessary, as, for example, in the case of Cluentius Habitus.\nBut it is not always desirable to employ the method\nadopted by Cicero against Sasia, not because he did not\nmake most admirable use of it, but because in such\ncases it makes the greatest difference what the point\nmay be and what the manner in which the mother\nseeks to injure her son. In the case of Sasia she hat\nopenly sought to procure the destruction of her son,\nand consequently vigorous methods were justified\nagainst her. But there were two points, the only\npoints which remained to be dealt with, that were\nhandled by Cicero with consummate skill in the\nfirst place, he does not forget the reverence that is\ndue to parents, and in the second, after a thorough\ninvestigation of the history of the crime, he makes\nit clear that it was not merely right, but a positive\nnecessity that he should say what he proposed to\nsay against the mother. And he placed this explantation in the forefront of his case, although it\nhad really nothing to do with the actual question at\nissue; a fact which shows that his first consideration\nin that difficult and complicated case was the consideration of what was becoming for him to say. He\ntherefore made the name of mother cast odium not\non the son, but on her who was the object of his\ndenunciations. It is, however, always possible that a mother may be her son's opponent in a case of less\nserious import, or at any rate in a way which involves\nless deadly hostility. Under such circumstances the\norator must adopt a gentler and more restrained\ntone. For example, we may offer apology for the\nline which we take, and thus lessen the odium\nwhich we incur or even transfer it to a different\nquarter, while if it be obvious that the son is deeply\ngrieved by the situation, it will be believed that he\nis blameless in the matter and he will even become\nan object of pity. It will also be desirable to throw\nthe blame on others, so that it may be believed that\nthe mother's action was instigated by their malice,\nand to assert that we will put up with every form of\nprovocation, and will say nothing harsh in reply, so\nthat, even although strong language may be absolutely necessary on our part, we may seem to be\ndriven to use it against our will. Nay, if some\ncharge has to be made against the mother, it will be\nthe advocate's task to make it seem that he does so\nagainst the desire of the son and from a sense of\nduty to his client. Thus both son and advocate will\nwin legitimate praise. What I have said about\nmothers will apply to either parent; for I have\nknown of litigation taking place between fathers\nand sons as well, after the emancipation of the son.\nAnd when other relationships are concerned, we\nmust take care to create the impression that we\nhave spoken with reluctance and under stress of\nnecessity and that we have been forbearing in our\nlanguage; but the importance of so doing will vary\naccording to the respect due to the persons concerned. The same courtesy should be observed in\nspeaking on behalf of freedmen against their patrons. In fact, to sum up, it will never become us to plead\nagainst such persons in a tone which we ourselves\nshould have resented in the mouth of men of like\ncondition. The same respect is on occasion due to\npersons of high rank, and it may be necessary to\noffer justification for our freedom of speech to avoid\ngiving the impression that we have shown ourselves\ninsolent or ostentatious in our attack upon such\npersons. Consequently Cicero, although he intended\nto speak against Cotta with the utmost vehemence,\nand indeed the case of Publius Oppius was such that\nhe could not do otherwise, prefaced his attack by\npleading at some length the necessity imposed upon\nhim by his duty to his client. Sometimes, again, it\nwill beseem us to spare or seem to spare our inferiors,\nmore especially if they be young. Cicero gives an\nexample of such moderation in the way in which he\ndeals with Atratinus in his defence of Caelius he\ndoes not lash him like an enemy, but admonishes\nhim almost like a father. For Atratinus was of\nnoble birth and young, and the grievance which led\nhim to bring the accusation was not unreasonable. But the task is comparatively easy in those cases\nin which it is to the judge, or even, it may be, to our\naudience that we have to indicate the reason for our\nmoderation. The real difficulty arises when we are\nafraid of offending those against whom we are\nspeaking. The difficulties of Cicero when defending\nMurena were increased by the fact that he was\nopposed by two persons of this character, namely\nMarcus Cato and Servius Sulpicius. And yet in\nwhat courteous language, after allowing Sulpicius all\nthe virtues, he refuses to admit that he has any idea\nof the way to conduct a candidature for the consulship. What else was there in which a man of high\nbirth and a distinguished lawyer would sooner\nadmit his inferiority With what skill he sets forth\nhis reasons for undertaking the defence of Murena,\nwhen he says that he supported Sulpicius' candidature as opposed to that of Murena, but did not\nregard that preference as reason why he should\nsupport him in bringing a capital charge against his\nrival And with what a light touch he deals with\nCato He has the highest admiration for his\ncharacter and desires to show that the fact that in\ncertain respects it has become severe and callous is due\nnot to any personal fault, but to the influence of the\nStoic school of philosophy; in fact you would imagine\nthat they were engaged not in a forensic dispute,\nbut merely in some philosophical discussion. This\nis undoubtedly the right method, and the safest rule\nin such cases will be to follow the practice of Cicero,\nnamely, that, when we desire to disparage a man\nwithout giving offence, we should allow him to be\nthe possessor of all other virtues and point out that\nit is only in this one respect that he falls short of\nhis high standard, while we should, if possible, add\nsome reason why this should be so, such, for example,\nas his being too obstinate or credulous or quick to\nanger, or acting under the influence of others.\nFor we may generally find a way out of such embarrassments by making it clear throughout our\nwhole speech that we not merely honour the object\nof our criticism, but even regard him with affection.\nFurther, we should have good cause for speaking thus\nand must do so not merely with moderation, but also\ngive the impression that our action is due to the\nnecessities of the case. A different situation arises, but an easier one, when we have to praise the actions\nof men who are otherwise disreputable or hateful to\nourselves for it is only right that we should award\npraise where it is deserved, whatever the character\nof the person praised may be. Cicero spoke in\ndefence of Gabinius and Publius Vatinius, both of\nthem his deadly enemies and men against whom\nhe had previously spoken and even published his\nspeeches but he justifies himself by declaring that\nhe does so not because he is anxious for his reputation as an accomplished speaker, but because he is\nconcerned for his honour. He had a more difficult\ntask in his defence of Cluentius, as it was necessary\nfor him to denounce Scamander's guilt, although he\nhad previously appeared for him. But he excuses\nhis action with the utmost grace, alleging the\nimportunity of those persons who had brought\nScamander to him, and his own youth at the time,\nwhereas it would have been a serious blot on his\nreputation, especially in connexion with a case of the\nmost dubious character, if he had admitted that he\nwas one who was ready to undertake the defence of\nguilty persons without asking awkward questions. On the other hand, when we are pleading before\na judge, who has special reasons for being hostile to\nus or is for some personal motive ill-disposed to the\ncause which we have undertaken, although it may\nbe difficult to persuade him, the method which we\nshould adopt in speaking is simple enough we shall\npretend that our confidence in his integrity and in\nthe justice of our cause is such that we have no\nfears. We must play upon his vanity by pointing out\nthat the less he indulges his own personal enmity\nor interest, the greater will be the reputation for conscientious rectitude that will accrue to him from\nhis verdict. The same method may be adopted if\nour case should chance to be sent back to the same\njudges from whom we have appealed but we may\nfurther, if the case should permit, plead that we\nwere forced to take the action which we did or were\nled to it by error or suspicion. The safest course\nwill therefore be to express our regret, apologise for\nour fault and employ every means to induce the\njudge to feel compunction for his anger. It will\nalso sometimes happen that a judge may have to try\nthe same case on which he has previously given\njudgment. In such circumstances the method\ncommonly adopted is to say that we should not\nhave ventured to dispute his sentence before any\nother judge, since he alone would be justified in\nrevising it but and in this we must be guided by\nthe circumstances of the case we may allege that\ncertain facts were not known on the previous\noccasion or certain witnesses were unavailable, or,\nthough this must be advanced with the utmost\ncaution and only in the last resort, that our clients'\nadvocates were unequal to their task. And even if\nwe have to plead a case afresh before different\njudges, as may occur in a second trial of a claim to\nfreedom or in cases in the centumviral courts, which\nare divided between two different panels, it will be\nmost seemly, if we have lost our case before the first\npanel, to say nothing against the judges who tried\nthe case on that occasion. But this is a subject\nwith which I dealt at some length in the passage\nwhere I discussed proofs. It may happen that we have to censure actions in\nothers, of which we have been guilty ourselves, as, for example, when Tubero charges Ligarius\nwith having been in Africa. Again, there have\nbeen cases where persons condemned for bribery\nhave indicted others for the same offence with a\nview to recovering their lost position for this\nthe schools provide a parallel in the theme where\na luxurious youth accuses his father of the same\noffence. I do not see how this can be done with\ndecorum unless we succeed in discovering some\ndifference between the two cases, such as character,\nage, motives, circumstances of time and place or\nintention. Tubero, for example, alleges that he\nwas a young man at the time and went thither\nin the company of his father, who had been sent by\nthe senate not to take part in the war, but to purchase corn, and further that he left the party as\nsoon as he could, whereas Ligarius clung to the\nparty and gave his support, not to Gnaeus Pompeius, who was engaged with Caesar in a struggle\nfor the supreme power, though both wished to\npreserve the state, but to Juba and the Africans\nwho were the sworn enemies of Rome. The easiest\ncourse, however, is to denounce another's guilt, while\nadmitting our own in the same connexion. However, that is the part of an informer, not of a\npleader. But if there is no excuse available, penitence is our only hope. For the man who is\nconverted to the hatred of his own errors, may\nperhaps be regarded as sufficiently reformed. For\nthere are occasionally circumstances which from\nthe very nature of the case may make such an\nattitude not unbecoming, as, for example, in the\ncase where the father disinherits a son born of a\nharlot because that son has married a harlot, a case which, although it forms a scholastic theme, might\nactually arise in a court of law. There are a number\nof pleas which the father may put forward with\nbecoming effect. He will say that it is the prayer\nof all parents that their sons should be better men\nthan themselves for example, if a daughter also\nhad been born to him, the harlot, her mother,\nwould have wished her to be chaste, or that he\nhimself was in a humbler position for a man in\nsuch a position is permitted to marry a harlot, or\nthat he had no father to warn him; and further\nthat there was an additional reason against his son's\nconduct, namely, that he should not revive the old\nfamily scandal nor reproach his father with his\nmarriage and his mother with the hard necessity\nof her former life, nor give a bad example to his\nown children in their turn. We may also plausibly\nsuggest that there is some particularly shameful\nfeature in the character of the harlot married by\nthe son, which the father cannot under existing\ncircumstances tolerate. There are other possible\narguments which I pass by for I am not now\nengaged in declamation, but am merely pointing\nout that there are occasions when the speaker may\nturn his own drawbacks to good account. More arduous difficulties confront us when we have\nto deal with a complaint of some shameful act such\nas rape, more especially when this is of an unnatural kind. I do not refer to cases when the\nvictim himself is speaking. For what should he do\nbut groan and weep and curse his existence, so that\nthe judge will understand his grief rather than hear\nit articulately expressed But the victim's advocate\nwill have to exhibit similar emotions, since the admission of such wrongs cause more shame to the\nsufferer than the criminal. In many cases it is\ndesirable to soften the harshness of our language\nby the infusion of a more conciliatory tone, as, for\nexample, Cicero did in his speech dealing with\nthe children of the proscribed. What fate could\nbe more cruel than that the children of men of\ngood birth and the descendants of distinguished\nancestors should be excluded from participation\nin public life For this reason that supreme artist\nin playing on the minds of men admits that it is\nhard, but asserts that the constitution is so essentially dependent on the laws of Sulla, that their\nrepeal would inevitably involve its destruction.\nThus he succeeded in creating the impression that\nlie was doing something on behalf of those very\npersons against whom he spoke. I have already\npointed out, in dealing with the subject of jests,\nhow unseemly it is to take the position in life of\nindividuals as the target for our gibes, and also\nhave urged that we should refrain from insulting\nwhole classes, races or communities. But at times\nour duty toward our client will force us to say\nsomething on the general character of a whole\nclass of people, such as freedmen, soldiers, tax farmers or the like. In all these cases the usual\nremedy is to create the impression that it is with\nreluctance that we introduce topics which must\ngive pain, while further we shall avoid attacking\neverything, and even while using the language\nof reproof with regard to the essential point of\nattack, shall make up for our censure by praising\nour victims in some other connexion. For example,\nif we charge soldiers with rapacity, we shall qualify our statement by saying that the fact is not\nsurprising, as they think that they are entitled to\nsome special reward for the perils they have faced\nand the wounds they have sustained. Or, if we\ncensure them for insolence, we shall add that this\nquality is due to the fact that they are more\naccustomed to war than to peace. In the case of\nfreedmen we should disparage their influence but\nwe may also give them credit for the industry\nwhich secured their emancipation. With regard\nto foreign nations, Cicero's practice varies. When\nhe intends to disparage the credibility of Greek\nwitnesses he admits their distinction in learning\nand literature and professes his admiration for their\nnation. On the other hand, he has nothing but\ncontempt for the Sardinians and attacks the Allobroges as the enemies of Rome. In all these cases\nnone of his remarks, at the time they were made,\nwere inconsistent with or adverse to the claims of\ndecorum. If there be anything offensive in the\nsubject on which we have to speak, it may be\ntoned down by a studied moderation in our language; for example, we may describe a brutal character as being unduly severe, an unjust man as led\nastray by prejudice, an obstinate man as unreasonably tenacious of his opinion. And there are a\nlarge number of cases where we should attempt to\ndefeat our opponents by reasoning, which forms the\ngentlest of all methods of attack. To these remarks I would add that all extravagance of any kind is indecorous, and consequently\nstatements which are in sufficient harmony with the\nfacts will none the less lose all their grace unless\nthey are modified by a certain restraint. It is hard to give rules as to the exact method in which this\nprecept should be observed, but the problem will\neasily be solved by following the dictates of our own\njudgement, which will tell us what it is sufficient to\nsay and how much the ears of our audience will\ntolerate. We cannot weigh or measure our words\nby fixed standards they are like foods, some of\nwhich are more satisfying than others. I think I should also add a few brief words to the\neffect that not only very different rhetorical virtues\nhave their special admirers, but that they are often\npraised by the same persons. For instance, there is\none passage in Cicero where he writes that the\nbest style is that which we think we can easily\nacquire by imitation, but which we find is really\nbeyond our powers. But in another passage he\nsays that his aim was not to speak in such a manner\nthat everyone should be confident that he could do\nthe same, but rather in a style that should be the\ndespair of all. These two statements may seem to\nbe inconsistent, but as a matter of fact both alike\ndeserve the praise which they receive. The difference is due to the fact that cases differ in character.\nThose of minor importance are admirably suited by\nthe simplicity and negligence of unaffected language, whereas cases of greater moment are best\nsuited by the grand style. Cicero is pre-eminent in\nboth. Now while eminence in one of these styles\nmay seem to the inexperienced to be within their\ngrasp, those who understand know that they are\ncapable of eminence in neither. II. Some regard memory as being no more than\none of nature's gifts; and this view is no doubt true\nto a great extent; but, like everything else, memory may be improved by cultivation. And all the labour\nof which I have so far spoken will be in vain unless\nall the other departments be co-ordinated by the\nanimating principle of memory. For our whole\neducation depends upon memory, and we shall\nreceive instruction all in vain if all we hear slips\nfrom us, while it is the power of memory alone\nthat brings before us all the store of precedents,\nlaws, rulings, sayings and facts which the orator\nmust possess in abundance and which he must\nalways hold ready for immediate use. Indeed\nit is not without good reason that memory has\nbeen called the treasure-house of eloquence. But\npleaders need not only to be able to retain a number\nof facts in their minds, but also to be quick to take\nthem in; it is not enough to learn what you have\nwritten by dint of repeated reading; it is just as\nnecessary to follow the order both of matter and\nwords when you have merely thought out what you\nare going to say, while you must also remember\nwhat has been said by your opponents, and must\nnot be content merely with refuting their arguments\nin the order in which they were advanced, but must\nbe in a position to deal with each in its appropriate\nplace. Nay, even extempore eloquence, in my\nopinion, depends on no mental activity so much\nas memory. For while we are saying one thing, we\nmust be considering something else that we are\ngoing to say consequently, since the mind is always\nlooking ahead, it is continually in search of something which is more remote on the other hand,\nwhatever it discovers, it deposits by some mysterious\nprocess in the safe-keeping of memory, which acts\nas a transmitting agent and hands on to the delivery what it has received from the imagination. I do\nnot conceive, however, that I need dwell upon the\nquestion of the precise function of memory, although\nmany hold the view that certain impressions are\nmade upon the mind, analogous to those which a\nsignet-ring makes on wax. Nor, again, shall I be so\ncredulous, in view of the fact that the retentiveness\nor slowness of the memory depends upon our\nphysical condition, as to venture to allot a special\nart to memory. My inclination is rather to marvel\nat its powers of reproducing and presenting a\nnumber of remote facts after so long an interval,\nand, what is more, of so doing not merely when we\nseek for such facts, but even at times of its own\naccord, and not only in our waking moments, but\neven when we are sunk in sleep. And my wonder is\nincreased by the fact that even beasts, which seem to\nbe devoid of reason, yet remember and recognise\nthings, and will return to their old home, however far\nthey have been taken from it. Again, is it not an\nextraordinary inconsistency that we forget recent and\nremember distant events, that we cannot recall what\nhappened yesterday and yet retain a vivid impression\nof the acts of our childhood And what, again, shall\nwe say of the fact that the things we search for\nfrequently refuse to present themselves and then\noccur to us by chance, or that memory does not\nalways remain with us, but will even sometimes\nreturn to us after it has been lost But we should\nnever have realised the fullness of its power nor its\nsupernatural capacities, but for the fact that it is\nmemory which has brought oratory to its present\nposition of glory. For it provides the orator not\nmerely with the order of his thoughts, but even of his words, nor is its power limited to stringing\nmerely a few words together; its capacity for endurance is inexhaustible, and even in the longest\npleadings the patience of the audience flags long\nbefore the memory of the speaker. This fact may\neven be advanced as an argument that there must\nbe some art of memory and that the natural gift can\nbe helped by reason, since training enables us to\ndo things which we cannot do before we have had\nany training or practice. On the other hand, I find\nthat Plato asserts that the use of written characters\nis a hindrance to memory, on the ground, that is, that\nonce we have committed a thing to writing, we\ncease to guard it in our memory and lose it out of\nsheer carelessness. And there can be no doubt that\nconcentration of mind is of the utmost importance in\nthis connexion; it is, in fact, like the eyesight, which\nturns to, and not away from, the objects which it\ncontemplates. Thus it results that after writing\nfor several days with a view to acquiring by heart\nwhat we have written, we find that our mental effort\nhas of itself imprinted it on our memory. The first person to discover an art of memory is\nsaid to have been Simonides, of whom the following\nwell-known story is told. He had written an ode\nof the kind usually composed in honour of victorious\nathletes, to celebrate the achievement of one who\nhad gained the crown for boxing. Part of the sum\nfor which he had contracted was refused him on\nthe ground that, following the common practice of\npoets, he had introduced a digression in praise of\nCastor and Pollux, and he was told that, in view\nof what he had done, he had best ask for the rest\nof the sum due from those whose deeds he had extolled. And according to the story they paid\ntheir debt. For when a great banquet was given\nin honour of the boxer's success, Simonides was\nsummoned forth from the feast, to which he had\nbeen invited, by a message to the effect that two\nyouths who had ridden to the door urgently desired\nhis presence. He found no trace of them, but what\nfollowed proved to him that the gods had shown\ntheir gratitude. For he had scarcely crossed the\nthreshold on his way out, when the banqueting hall\nfell in upon the heads of the guests and wrought\nsuch havoc among them that the relatives of the\ndead who came to seek the bodies for burial were\nunable to distinguish not merely the faces but even\nthe limbs of the dead. Then it is said, Simonides,\nwho remembered the order in which the guests had\nbeen sitting, succeeded in restoring to each man his\nown dead. There is, however, great disagreement\namong our authorities as to whether this ode was\nwritten in honour of Glaucus of Carystus, Leocrates,\nAgatharcus or Scopas, and whether the house was\nat Pharsalus, as Simonides himself seems to indicate\nin a certain passage, and as is recorded by Apollodorus, Eratosthenes, Euphorion and Eurypylus of\nLarissa, or at Crannon, as is stated by Apollas\nCallimachus, who is followed by Cicero, to whom\nthe wide circulation of this story is due. It is\nagreed that Scopas, a Thessalian noble, perished at\nthis banquet, and it is also said that his sister's son\nperished with him, while it is thought that a number\nof descendants of an elder Scopas met their death\nat the same time. For my own part, however, I\nregard the portion of the story which concerns\nCastor and Pollux as being purely fictitious, since the poet himself has nowhere mentioned the occurrence; and he would scarcely have kept silence on\nan affair which was so much to his credit. This achievement of Simonides appears to have\ngiven rise to the observation that it is an assistance\nto the memory if localities are sharply impressed\nupon the mind, a view the truth of which everyone\nmay realise by practical experiment. For when we\nreturn to a place after considerable absence, we not\nmerely recognise the place itself, but remember\nthings that we did there, and recall the persons\nwhom we met and even the unuttered thoughts\nwhich passed through our minds when we were\nthere before. Thus, as in most cases, art originates in experiment. Some place is chosen of the\nlargest possible extent and characterised by the\nutmost possible variety, such as a spacious house\ndivided into a number of rooms. Everything of\nnote therein is carefully committed to the memory,\nin order that the thought may be enabled to run\nthrough all the details without let or hindrance.\nAnd undoubtedly the first task is to secure that\nthere shall be no delay in finding any single detail,\nsince an idea which is to lead by association to\nsome other idea requires to be fixed in the mind\nwith more than ordinary certitude. The next step\nis to distinguish something which has been written\ndown or merely thought of by some particular\nsymbol which will serve to jog the memory; this\nsymbol may have reference to the subject as a\nwhole, it may, for example, be drawn from navigation, warfare, etc., or it may, on the other hand,\nbe found in some particular word. For even in\ncases of forgetfulness one single word will serve to restore the memory. However, let us suppose that\nthe symbol is drawn from navigation, as, for instance,\nan anchor; or from warfare, as, for example, some\nweapon. These symbols are then arranged as follows.\nThe first though is placed, as it were, in the forecourt;\nthe second, let us say, in the living-room; the remainder are placed in due order all round the impluvium and entrusted not merely to bedrooms and\nparlours, but even to the care of statues and the\nlike. This done, as soon as the memory of the facts\nrequires to be revived, all these places are visited in\nturn and the various deposits are demanded from\ntheir custodians, as the sight of each recalls the\nrespective details. Consequently, however large the\nnumber of these which it is required to remember,\nall are linked one to the other like dancers\nhand in hand, and there can be no mistake since\nthey join what precedes to what follows, no trouble\nbeing required except the preliminary labour of\ncommitting the various points to memory. What\nI have spoken of as being done in a house, can\nequally well be done in connexion with public\nbuildings, a long journey, the ramparts of a city,\nor even pictures. Or we may even imagine such\nplaces to ourselves. We require, therefore,\nplaces, real or imaginary, and images or symbols,\nwhich we must, of course, invent for ourselves. By\nimages I mean the words by which we distinguish\nthe things which we have to learn by heart in\nfact, as Cicero says, we use It will be best to\ngive his words verbatim This makes me wonder all the\nmore, how Metrodorus should have found three\nhundred and sixty different localities in the twelve\nsigns of the Zodiac through which the sun passes.\nIt was doubtless due to the vanity and boastfulness\nof a man who was inclined to vaunt his memory as\nbeing the result of art rather than of natural gifts. I am far from denying that those devices may be\nuseful for certain purposes, as, for example, if we\nhave to reproduce a number of names in the order\nin which we heard them. For those who use such\naids place the things which have to be remembered\nin localities which they have previously fixed in the\nmemory; they put a table, for instance, in the forecourt, a platform in the hall and so on with the\nrest, and then, when they retrace their steps, they\nfind the objects where they had placed them. Such\na practice may perhaps have been of use to those\nwho, after an auction, have succeeded in stating\nwhat object they had sold to each buyer, their statements being checked by the books of the money takers; a feat which it is alleged was performed by\nHortensius. It will, however, be of less service in\nlearning the various parts of a set speech. For\nthoughts do not call up the same images as material\nthings, and a symbol requires to be specially invented\nfor them, although even here a particular place may\nserve to remind us, as, for example, of some conversation that may have been held there. But how\ncan such a method grasp a whole series of connected words I pass by the fact that there are\ncertain things which it is impossible to represent by symbols, as, for example, conjunctions. We may, it\nis true, like shorthand writers, have definite symbols\nfor everything, and may select an infinite number\nof places to recall all the words contained in the\nfive books of the second pleading against Verres,\nand we may even remember them all as if they\nwere deposits placed in safe-keeping. But will not\nthe flow of our speech inevitably be impeded by the\ndouble task imposed upon our memory For how\ncan our words be expected to flow in connected\nspeech, if we have to look back at separate symbols\nfor each individual word Therefore the experts\nmentioned by Cicero as having trained their\nmemory by methods of this kind, namely Charmadas, and Metrodorus of Scepsis, to whom I have\njust referred, may keep their systems for their own\nuse. My precepts on the subject shall be of a\nsimpler kind. If a speech of some length has to be committed\nto memory, it will be well to learn it piecemeal,\nsince there is nothing so bad for the memory as being\noverburdened. But the sections into which we divide\nit for this purpose should not be very short otherwise\nthey will be too many in number, and will break up\nand distract the memory. I am not, however, prepared to recommend any definite length; it will depend on the natural limits of the passage concerned,\nunless, indeed, it be so long as itself to require subdivision. But some limits must be fixed to enable us,\nby dint of frequent and continuous practice, to connect\nthe words in their proper order, which is a task of no\nsmall difficulty, and subsequently to unite the various\nsections into a whole when we go over them in\norder. If certain portions prove especially difficult to remember, it will be found advantageous to indicate\nthem by certain marks, the remembrance of which\nwill refresh and stimulate the memory. For there can\nbe but few whose memory is so barren that they will\nfail to recognise the symbols with which they have\nmarked different passages. But if anyone is slow to\nrecognise his own signs, he should employ the following additional remedy, which, though drawn from the\nmnemonic system discussed above, is not without its\nuses he will adapt his symbols to the nature of the\nthoughts which tend to slip from his memory, using\nan anchor, as I suggested above, if he has to speak\nof a ship, or a spear, if he has to speak of a battle.\nFor symbols are highly efficacious, and one idea\nsuggests another for example, if we change a ring\nfrom one finger to another or tie a thread round it,\nit will serve to remind us of our reason for so doing.\nSpecially effective are those devices which lead the\nmemory from one thing to another similar thing which\nwe have got to remember; for example, in the case of\nnames, if we desire to remember the name Fabius,\nwe should think of the famous Cunctator, whom we\nare certain not to forget, or of some friend bearing\nthe same name. This is specially easy with names\nsuch as Aper, Ursus, Naso, or Crispus, since in\nthese cases we can fix their origin in our memory.\nOrigin again may assist us to a better remembrance of derivative names, such as Cicero, Verrius,\nor Aurelius. However, I will say no more on this\npoint. There is one thing which will be of assistance to\neveryone, namely, to learn a passage by heart from\nthe same tablets on which he has committed it to\nwriting. For he will have certain tracks to guide him in his pursuit of memory, and the mind's eye\nwill be fixed not merely on the pages on which the\nwords were written, but on individual lines, and at\ntimes he will speak as though he were reading aloud.\nFurther, if the writing should be interrupted by\nsome erasure, addition or alteration, there are certain\nsymbols available, the sight of which will prevent us\nfrom wandering from the track. This device bears\nsome resemblance to the mnemonic system which\nI mentioned above, but if my experience is worth\nanything, is at once more expeditious and more\neffective. The question has been raised as to\nwhether we should learn by heart in silence; it\nwould be best to do so, save for the fact that under\nsuch circumstances the mind is apt to become indolent, with the result that other thoughts break in.\nFor this reason the mind should be kept alert by the\nsound of the voice, so that the memory may derive\nassistance from the double effort of speaking and\nlistening. But our voice should be subdued, rising\nscarcely above a murmur. On the other hand, if we\nattempt to learn by heart from another reading\naloud, we shall find that there is both loss and gain;\non the one hand, the process of learning will be\nslower, because the perception of the eye is quicker\nthan that of the ear, while, on the other hand, when\nwe have heard a passage once or twice, we shall be\nin a position to test our memory and match it against\nthe voice of the reader. It is, indeed, important for\nother reasons to test ourselves thus from time to time,\nsince continuous reading has this drawback, that it\npasses over the passages which we find hard to remember at the same speed as those which we find less\ndifficulty in retaining. By testing ourselves to see whether we remember a passage, we develop greater\nconcentration without waste of time over the repetition of passages which we already know by heart.\nThus, only those passages which tend to slip from\nthe memory are repeated with a view to fixing them\nin the mind by frequent rehearsal, although as a rule\nthe mere fact that they once slipped our memory\nmakes us ultimately remember them with special\naccuracy. Both learning by heart and writing have\nthis feature in common namely, that good health,\nsound digestion, and freedom from other preoccupations of mind contribute largely to the success of\nboth. But for the purpose of getting a real grasp\nof what we have written under the various heads,\ndivision and artistic structure will be found of great\nvalue, while, with the exception of practice, which\nis the most powerful aid of all, they are practically\nthe only means of ensuring an accurate remembrance\nof what we have merely thought out. For correct\ndivision will be an absolute safeguard against error in\nthe order of our speech, since there are certain points\nnot merely in the distribution of the various questions\nin our speech, but also in their development provided we speak as we ought, which naturally come\nfirst, second, and third, and so on, while the connexion\nwill be so perfect that nothing can be omitted or\ninserted without the fact of the omission or insertion being obvious. We are told that Scaevola,\nafter a game of draughts in which he made the first\nmove and was defeated, went over the whole game\nagain in his mind on his way into the country, and\non recalling the move which had cost him the game,\nreturned to tell the man with whom he had been\nplaying, and the latter acknowledged that he was right. Is order, then, I ask you, to be accounted of\nless importance in a speech, in which it depends\nentirely on ourselves, whereas in a game our opponent\nhas an equal share in its development Again, if\nour structure be what it should, the artistic sequence will serve to guide the memory. For just\nas it is easier to learn verse than prose, so it is\neasier to learn prose when it is artistically constructed than when it has no such organisation. If\nthese points receive attention, it will be possible to\nrepeat verbatim even such psssages as gave the impression of being delivered extempore. My own\nmemory is of a very ordinary kind, but I found that\nI could do this with success on occasions when the\ninterruption of a declamation by persons who had a\nclaim to such a courtesy forced me to repeat part of\nwhat I had said. There are persons still living, who\nwere then present to witness if I lie. However, if anyone asks me what is the one\nsupreme method of memory, I shall reply, practice\nand industry. The most important thing is to learn\nmuch by heart and to think much, and, if possible,\nto do this daily, since there is nothing that is more\nincreased by practice or impaired by neglect than\nmemory. Therefore boys should, as I have already\nurged, learn as much as possible by heart at the\nearliest stage, while all who, whatever their age,\ndesire to cultivate the power of memory, should\nendeavour to swallow the initial tedium of reading\nand re-reading what they have written or read, a\nprocess which we may compare to chewing the cud.\nThis task will be rendered less tiresome if we begin\nby confining ourselves to learning only a little at a\ntime, in amounts not sufficient to create disgust we may then proceed to increase the amount by a line a\nday, an addition which will not sensibly increase the\nlabour of learning, until at last the amount we can\nattack will know no limits. We should begin with\npoetry and then go on to oratory, while finally we\nmay attempt passages still freer in rhythm and less\nakin to ordinary speech, such, for example, as\npassages from legal writers. For passages intended\nas an exercise should be somewhat difficult in character if they are to make it easy to achieve the end\nfor which the exercise is designed; just as athletes\ntrain the muscles of their hands by carrying weights of\nlead, although in the actual contests their hands will\nbe empty and free. Further, I must not omit the\nfact, the truth of which our daily practice will teach\nus, that in the case of the slower type of mind the\nmemory of recent events is far from being exact. It is\na curious fact, of which the reason is not obvious, that\nthe interval of a single night will greatly increase\nthe strength of the memory, whether this be due to\nthe fact that it has rested from the labour, the\nfatigue of which constituted the obstacle to success,\nor whether it be that the power of recollection,\nwhich is the most important element of memory,\nundergoes a process of ripening and maturing\nduring the time which intervenes. Whatever the\ncause, things which could not be recalled on the\nspot are easily co-ordinated the next day, and time\nitself, which is generally accounted one of the causes\nof forgetfulness, actually serves to strengthen the\nmemory. On the other hand, the abnormally rapid\nmemory fails as a rule to last and takes its leave as\nthough, its immediate task accomplished, it had no\nfurther duties to perform. And indeed there is nothing surprising in the fact that things which\nhave been implanted in the memory for some time\nshould have a greater tendency to stay there. The difference between the powers of one mind\nand another, to which I have just referred, gives rise\nto the question whether those who are intending to\nspeak should learn their speeches verbatim or whether\nit is sufficient to get a good grasp of the essence and\nthe order of what they have got to say. To this\nproblem no answer is possible that will be of universal application. Give me a reliable memory and\nplenty of time, and I should prefer not to permit\na single syllable to escape me otherwise writing\nwould be superfluous. It is specially important to\ntrain the young to such precision, and the memory\nshould be continually practised to this end, that we\nmay never learn to become indulgent to its failure.\nFor this reason I regard it as a mistake to permit the\nstudent to be prompted or to consult his manuscript,\nsince such practices merely encourage carelessness,\nand no one will ever realise that he has not got his\ntheme by heart, if he has no fear of forgetting it.\nIt is this which causes interruptions in the flow of\nspeech and makes the orator's language halting and\njerky, while he seems as though he were learning\nwhat he says by heart and loses all the grace that a\nwell-written speech can give, simply by the fact that\nhe makes it obvious that he has written it. On the\nother hand, a good memory will give us credit for\nquickness of wit as well, by creating the impression\nthat our words have not been prepared in the seclusion of the study, but are due to the inspiration\nof the moment, an impression which is of the utmost\nassistance both to the orator and to his cause. For the judge admires those words more and fears them\nless which he does not suspect of having been\nspecially prepared beforehand to outwit him.\nFurther, we must make it one of our chief aims\nin pleading to deliver passages which have been\nconstructed with the utmost care, in such manner\nas to make it appear that they are but casually strung\ntogether, and to suggest that we are thinking out\nand hesitating over words which we have, as a\nmatter of fact, carefully prepared in advance. It should now be clear to all what is the best\ncourse to adopt for the cultivation of memory. If,\nhowever, our memory be naturally somewhat dull\nor time presses, it will be useless to tie ourselves\ndown rigidly to every word, since if we forget any\none of them, the result may be awkward hesitation or even a tongue-tied silence. It is, therefore,\nfar safer to secure a good grasp of the facts themselves and to leave ourselves free to speak as we\nwill. For the loss of even a single word that we\nhave chosen is always a matter for regret, and it is\nhard to supply a substitute when we are searching\nfor the word that we had written. But even this\nis no remedy for a weak memory, except for those\nwho have acquired the art of speaking extempore.\nBut if both memory and this gift be lacking, I\nshould advise the would-be orator to abandon the\ntoil of pleading altogether and, if he has any literary\ncapacity, to betake himself by preference to writing.\nBut such a misfortune will be of but rare occurrence. For the rest there are many historical examples\nof the power to which memory may be developed by\nnatural aptitude and application. Themistocles is\nsaid to have spoken excellently in Persian after a year's study; Mithridates is recorded to have known\ntwenty-two languages, that being the number of\nthe different nations included in his empire; Crassus,\nsurnamed the Rich, when commanding in Asia had\nsuch a complete mastery of five different Greek\ndialects, that he would give judgement in the dialect\nemployed by the plaintiff in putting forward his\nsuit; Cyrus is believed to have known the name\nof every soldier in his army, while Theodectes is\nactually said to have been able to repeat any number\nof verses after only a single hearing. I remember\nthat it used to be alleged that there were persons\nstill living who could do the same, though I never\nhad the good fortune to be present at such a performance. Still, we shall do well to have faith in\nsuch miracles, if only that he who believes may also\nhope to achieve the like. III. Delivery is often styled action. But the first\nname is derived from the voice, the second from the\ngesture. For Cicero in one passage speaks of action\nas being a form of speech, and in another as being\na kind of physical eloquence. None the less, he\ndivides action into two elements, which are the\nsame as the elements of delivery, namely, voice and\nmovement. Therefore, it matters not which term\nwe employ. But the thing itself has an extraordinarily powerful effect in oratory. For the\nnature of the speech that we have composed within\nour minds is not so important as the manner in\nwhich we produce it, since the emotion of each\nmember of our audience will depend on the impression made upon his hearing. Consequently, no\nproof, at least if it be one devised by the orator\nhimself, will ever be so secure as not to lose its force if the speaker fails to produce it in tones that drive\nit home. All emotional appeals will inevitably fall\nflat, unless they are given the fire that voice, look,\nand the whole carriage of the body can give them.\nFor when we have done all this, we may still\naccount ourselves only too fortunate if we have\nsucceeded in communicating the fire of our passion\nto the judge consequently, we can have no hope\nof moving him if we speak with languor and indifference, nor of preventing him from yielding to the\nnarcotic influence of our own yawns. A proof of this\nis given by actors in the theatre. For they add so\nmuch to the charm even of the greatest poets, that\nthe verse moves us far more when heard than when\nread, while they succeed in securing a hearing even\nfor the most worthless authors, with the result\nthat they repeatedly win a welcome on the\nstage that is denied them in the library. Now\nif delivery can count for so much in themes\nwhich we know to be fictitious and devoid of reality,\nas to arouse our anger, our tears or our anxiety, how\nmuch greater must its effect be when we actually\nbelieve what we hear For my own part I would\nnot hesitate to assert that a mediocre speech supported by all the power of delivery will be more\nimpressive than the best speech unaccompanied by\nsuch power. It was for this reason that Demosthenes, when asked what was the most important\nthing in oratory, gave the palm to delivery and\nassigned it second and third place as well, until\nhis questioner ceased to trouble him. We are\ntherefore almost justified in concluding that he\nregarded it not merely as the first, but as the only\nvirtue of oratory. This explains why he studied under the instruction of the actor Andronicus with\nsuch diligence and success as thoroughly to justify\nthe remark made by Aeschines to the Rhodians when\nthey expressed their admiration of the speech of\nDemosthenes on behalf of Ctesiphon, Cicero likewise regards action as the supreme element\nof oratory. He records that Gnaeus Lentulus acquired a greater reputation by his delivery than\nby his actual eloquence, and that Gains Gracchus\nby the same means stirred the whole Roman people\nto tears when he bewailed his brother's death,\nwhile Antonius and Crassus produced a great impression by their command of this quality, though\nthe greatest of all was that produced by Quintus\nHortensius. This statement is strongly supported\nby the fact that the latter's writings fall so far\nshort of the reputation which for so long secured\nhim the first place among orators, then for a\nwhile caused him to be regarded as Cicero's rival,\nand finally, for the remainder of his life assigned\nhim a position second only to that of Cicero, that\nhis speaking must clearly have possessed some\ncharm which we fail to find when we read him.\nAnd, indeed, since words in themselves count for\nmuch and the voice adds a force of its own to the\nmatter of which it speaks, while gesture and motion\nare full of significance, we may be sure of finding\nsomething like perfection when all these qualities\nare combined. There are some, however, who consider that delivery which owes nothing to art and everything to\nnatural impulse is more forcible, and in fact the only\nform of delivery which is worthy of a manly speaker. But these persons are as a rule identical, either with\nthose who are in the habit of disapproving of care,\nart, polish and every form of premeditation in actual\nspeaking, as being affected and unnatural, or else\nwith those who like Lucius Cotta, according to\nCicero affect the imitation of ancient writers both\nin their choice of words and even in the rudeness of\ntheir intonation and rhythm. Those, however, who\nthink it sufficient for men to be born to enable them\nto become orators, are welcome to their opinion, and\nI must ask them to be indulgent to the efforts to\nwhich I am committed by my belief that we cannot\nhope to attain perfection unless nature is assisted by\nstudy. But I will not be so obstinate as to deny\nthat to nature must be assigned the first place. For\na good delivery is undoubtedly impossible for one\nwho cannot remember what he has written, or lacks\nthe quick facility of speech required by sudden\nemergencies, or is hampered by incurable impediments of speech. Again, physical uncouthness may\nbe such that no art can remedy it, while a weak\nvoice is incompatible with first-rate excellence in\ndelivery. For we may employ a good, strong voice\nas we will; whereas one that is ugly or feeble not\nonly prevents us from producing a number of effects,\nsuch as a crescendo or a sudden fortissimo, but at\ntimes forces faults upon us, making us drop the\nvoice, alter its pitch and refresh the hoarseness of\nthe throat and fatigue of the lungs by a hideous\nchanting intonation. However, let me now turn to\nconsider the speaker on whom my precepts will not\nbe wasted. All delivery, as I have already said, is concerned\nwith two different things, namely, voice and gesture, of which the one appeals to the eye and the other\nto the ear, the two senses by which all emotion\nreaches the soul. But the voice has the first claim\non our attention, since even our gesture is adapted\nto suit it. The first point which calls for consideration is the\nnature of the voice, the second the manner in which\nit is used. The nature of the voice depends on its\nquantity and quality. The question of quantity is\nthe simpler of the two, since as a rule it is either\nstrong or weak, although there are certain kinds of\nvoice which fall between these extremes, and there\nare a number of gradations from the highest notes to\nthe lowest and from the lowest to the highest.\nQuality, on the other hand, presents more variations;\nfor the voice may be clear or husky, full or thin,\nsmooth or harsh, of wide or narrow compass, rigid or\nflexible, and sharp or flat, while lung-power may be\ngreat or small. It is not necessary for my purpose\nto enquire into the causes which give rise to these\npeculiarities. I need not raise the question whether\nthe difference lies in those organs by which the\nbreath is produced, or in those which form the\nchannels for the voice itself; whether the voice has\na character of its own or depends on the motions\nwhich produce it; whether it be the strength of the\nlungs, chest or the vocal organs themselves that\naffords it most assistance, since the co-operation of\nall these organs is required. For example, it is not\nthe mouth only that produces sweetness of tone; it\nrequires the assistance of the nostrils as well, which\ncarry off what I may describe as the overflow of the\nvoice. The important fact is that the tone must be\nagreeable and not harsh. The methods of using the voice present great variety. For in addition to the\ntriple division of accents into sharp, grave and circumflex, there are many other forms of intonation\nwhich are required it may be intense or relaxed,\nhigh or low, and may move in slow or quick time.\nBut here again there are many intermediate\ngradations between the two extremes, and just as\nthe face, although it consists of a limited number\nof features, yet possesses infinite variety of expression,\nso it is with the voice for though it possesses but\nfew varieties to which we can give a name, yet every\nhuman being possesses a distinctive voice of his\nown, which is as easily distinguished by the ear as\nare facial characteristics by the eye. The good qualities of the voice, like everything\nelse, are improved by training and impaired by\nneglect. But the training required by the orator is\nnot the same as that which is practised by the singing-master, although the two methods have many\npoints in common. In both cases physical robustness\nis essential to save the voice from dwindling to the\nfeeble shrillness that characterises the voices of\neunuchs, women and invalids, and the means for\ncreating such robustness are to be found in walking,\nrubbing-down with oil, abstinence from sexual intercourse, an easy digestion, and, in a word, in the\nsimple life. Further, the throat must be sound,\nthat is to say, soft and smooth; for if the throat be\nunsound, the voice is broken or dulled or becomes\nharsh or squeaky. For just as the sound produced\nin the pipe by the same volume of breath varies\naccording as the stops are closed or open, or the\ninstrument is clogged or cracked, so the voice is\nstrangled if the throat be swollen, and muffled if it is obstructed, while it becomes rasping if the throat\nis inflamed, and may be compared to an organ with\nbroken pipes in cases where the throat is subject to\nspasms. Again, the presence of some obstacle may\ndivide the breath just as a pebble will divide shallow\nwaters, which, although their currents unite again\nsoon after the obstruction is past, still leave a hollow\nspace in rear of the object struck. An excess of\nmoisture also impedes the voice, while a deficiency\nweakens it. As regards fatigue, its effect is the same\nas upon the body it affects the voice not merely at\nthe moment of speaking, but for some time afterwards. But while exercise, which gives strength in\nall cases, is equally necessary both for orators and\nsinging-masters, it is a different kind of exercise\nwhich they require. For the orator is too much\noccupied by civil affairs to be able to allot fixed\ntimes for taking a walk, and he cannot tune his\nvoice through all the notes of the scale nor spare\nit exertion, since it is frequently necessary for him\nto speak in several cases in succession. Nor is the\nsame regime suitable as regards food for the orator\nneeds a strong and enduring voice rather than one\nwhich is soft and sweet, while the singer mellows all\nsounds, even the highest, by the modulation of his\nvoice, whereas we have often to speak in harsh and\nagitated tones, must pass wakeful nights, swallow\nthe soot that is produced by the midnight oil and\nstick to our work though our clothes be dripping\nwith sweat. Consequently, we must not attempt to\nmellow our voice by coddling it nor accustom it to\nthe conditions which it would like to enjoy, but\nrather give it exercise suited to the tasks on which\nit will be employed, never allowing it to be impaired by silence, but strengthening it by practice, which\nremoves all difficulties. The best method for securing such exercise is to learn passages by heart for if\nwe have to speak extempore, the passion inspired by\nour theme will distract us from all care for our voice,\nwhile the passages selected for the purpose should\nbe as varied as possible, involving a combination\nof loud, argumentative, colloquial and modulated\nutterance, so that we may prepare ourselves for all\nexigencies simultaneously. This will be sufficient.\nOtherwise your delicate, over trained voice will\nsuccumb before any unusual exertion, like bodies\naccustomed to the oil of the training school, which\nfor all the imposing robustness which they display\nin their own contests, yet, if ordered to make a day's\nmarch with the troops, to carry burdens and mount\nguard at night, would faint beneath the task and\nlong for their trainers to rub them down with oil and\nfor the free perspiration of the naked limbs. Who\nwould tolerate me if in a work such as this I were\nto prescribe avoidance of exposure to sun, wind, rain\nor parching heat If we are called upon to speak\nin the sun or on a windy, wet or warm day, is that a\nreason for deserting the client whom we have undertaken to defend While as for the warning given\nby some that the orator should not speak when\ndyspeptic, replete or drunk, or immediately after\nvomiting, I think that no sane person would dream\nof declaiming under such circumstances. There is,\nhowever, good reason for the rule prescribed by all\nauthorities, that the voice should not be overstrained\nin the years of transition between boyhood and manhood, since at that period it is naturally weak, not, I\nthink, on account of heat, as some allege for there is more heat in the body at other periods, but rather\non account of moisture, of which at that age there is\na superabundance. For this reason the nostrils and\nthe breast swell at this stage, and all the organs\ndevelop new growth, with the result that they are\ntender and liable to injury. However, to return to\nthe point, the best and most realistic form of exercise\nfor the voice, once it has become firm and set, is, in\nmy opinion, the practice of speaking daily just as we\nplead in the courts. For thus, not merely do the\nvoice and lungs gain in strength, but we acquire a\nbecoming deportment of the body and develop grace\nof movement suited to our style of speaking. The rules for delivery are identical with those for the\nlanguage of oratory itself. For, as our language must\nbe correct, clear, ornate and appropriate, so with our\ndelivery; it will be correct, that is, free from fault, if\nour utterance be fluent, clear, pleasant and that is to say, free from all traces of a rustic or a foreign\naccent. For there is good reason for the saying we so\noften hear, \nsince we may discern a man's nationality from the\nsound of his voice as easily as we test a coin by its ring.\nIf these qualities be present, we shall have those harmonious accents of which Ennius expresses his\napproval when he describes Cethegus as one whose and avoid the opposite effect,\nof which Cicero expresses his disapproval by saying, For there are many faults\nof which I spoke in the first book when I discussed\nthe method in which the speech of children should\nbe formed, since I thought it more appropriate to\nmention them in connexion with a period of life\nwhen it is still possible to correct them. Again, the delivery may be described as correct if the voice be\nsound, that is to say, exempt from any of the defects\nof which I have just spoken, and if it is not dull,\ncoarse, exaggerated, hard, stiff, hoarse or thick, or\nagain, thin, hollow, sharp, feeble, soft or effeminate,\nand if the breath is neither too short nor difficult to\nsustain or recover. The delivery will be clear if, in the first place, the\nwords are uttered in their entirety, instead of being\nswallowed or clipped, as is so often the case, since\ntoo many people fail to complete the final syllables\nthrough over-emphasising the first. But although\nwords must be given their full phonetic value, it is a\ntiresome and offensive trick to pronounce every letter\nas if we were entering them in an inventory. For\nvowels frequently coalesce and some consonants disappear when followed by a vowel. I have already\ngiven an example of both these occurrences\nmullum ille et terris. Further, we avoid placing two\nconsonants near each other when their juxtaposition\nwould cause a harsh sound; thus, we say pellexit and\ncollegiate and employ other like forms of which I have\nspoken elsewhere. It is with this in mind that\nCicero praises Catulus for the sweetness with which\nhe pronounced the various letters. The second\nessential for clearness of delivery is that our\nlanguage should be properly punctuated, that is\nto say, the speaker must begin and end at the\nproper place. It is also necessary to note at what\npoint our speech should pause and be momentarily\nsuspended which the Greeks term and and when it should come to a full stop.\nAfter the words arma virumque cano there is a momentary suspension, because virum is connected with what follows, the full sense being given by virum\nTroiae qui primus ab oris, after which there is a similar suspension. For although the mention of the\nhero's destination introduces an idea different from\nthat of the place whence he came, the difference does\nnot call for the insertion of a stop, since both ideas\nare expressed by the same verb venit. After Italiam\ncomes a third pause, since fato profugus is parenthetic and breaks up the continuity of the phrase\nItalian, Lavinaque. For the same reason there is a\nfourth pause after profulgus. Then follows Lavinaque\nvenit litora, where a stop must be placed, as at this\npoint a new sentence begins. But stops themselves\nvary in length, according as they mark the conclusion\nof a phrase or a sentence. Thus after litora I shall\npause and continue after taking breath. But when\nI come to atque altae moenia Romae I shall make a full\nstop, halt and start again with the opening of a fresh\nsentence. There are also occasionally, even in\nperiods, pauses which do not require a fresh breath.\nFor although the sentence in coetu vero populi Romani,\nnegotium publicumn gerens, magister equilum, etc., contains a number of different cola, expressing a number\nof different thoughts, all these cola are embraced by\na single period consequently, although short pauses\nare required at the appropriate intervals, the flow of\nthe period as a whole must not be broken. On the\nother hand, it is at times necessary to take breath without any perceptible pause in such cases we must do\nso surreptitiously, since if we take breath unskilfully,\nit will cause as much obscurity as would have resulted\nfrom faulty punctuation. Correctness of punctuation\nmay seem to be but a trivial merit, but without it\nall the other merits of oratory are nothing worth. Delivery will be ornate when it is supported by\na voice that is easy, strong, rich, flexible, firm, sweet,\nenduring, resonant, pure, carrying far and penetrating the ear for there is a type of voice which\nimpresses the hearing not by its volume, but by its\npeculiar quality in addition, the voice must be\neasily managed and must possess all the necessary\ninflexions and modulations, in fact it must, as the\nsaying is, be a perfect instrument, equipped with\nevery stop further, it must have strong lungs to\nsustain it, and ample breathing power that will be\nequal to all demands upon it, however fatiguing. The\ndeepest bass and the highest treble notes are unsuited to oratory for the former lack clearness and,\nowing to their excessive fullness, have no emotional\npower, while the latter are too thin and, owing to\nexcess of clearness, give an impression of extravagance and are incompatible with the inflexions\ndemanded by delivery and place too great a strain\nupon the voice. For the voice is like the strings of\na musical instrument; the slacker it is the deeper\nand fuller the note produced, whereas if it be\ntightened, the sound becomes thinner and shriller.\nConsequently, the deepest notes lack force, and the\nhigher run the risk of cracking the voice. The orator\nwill, therefore, employ the intermediate notes, which\nmust be raised when we speak with energy and\nlowered when we adopt a more subdued tone. For the first essential of a good delivery is evenness. The voice must not run joltingly, with\nirregularity of rhythm and sound, mixing long and\nshort syllables, grave accents and acute, tones loud\nand low, without discrimination, the result being that\nthis universal unevenness produces the impression of a limping gait. The second essential is variety of\ntone, and it is in this alone that delivery really consists. I must warn my readers not to fall into the\nerror of supposing that evenness and variety are incompatible with one another, since the fault opposed\nto evenness is unevenness, while the opposite of\nvariety is that which the Greeks term or\nuniformity of aspect. The art of producing variety\nnot merely charms and refreshes the ear, but, by the\nvery fact that it involves a change of effort, revives\nthe speaker's flagging energies. It is like the relief\ncaused by changes in position, such as are involved\nby standing, walking, sitting and lying, none of\nwhich can be endured for a long time together.\nBut the most important point which I shall proceed\nto discuss a little later is the necessity of adapting\nthe voice to suit the nature of the various subjects\non which we are speaking and the moods that they\ndemand otherwise our voice will be at variance with\nour language. We must, therefore, avoid that which\nthe Greeks call monotony, that is to say, the unvarying exertion both of lungs and voice. By this I do\nnot simply mean that we must avoid saying everything in a loud tone, a fault which amounts to\nmadness, or in a colloquial tone, which creates an\nimpression of lifelessness, or in a subdued murmur,\nwhich is utterly destructive of all vigour. What I\nmean is this within the limits of one passage and the\ncompass of one emotion we may vary our tone to a\ncertain, though not a very great extent, according\nas the dignity of the language, the nature of the\nthought, the conclusion and opening of our sentences or transitions from one point to another, may\ndemand. Thus, those who paint in monochrome still represent their objects in different planes, since\notherwise it would have been impossible to depict\neven the limbs of their figures. Let us take as an\nexample the opening of Cicero's magnificent speech\nin defence of Milo. Is it not clear that the orator\nhas to change his tone almost at every stop it is the\nsame face, but the expression is changed. Etsi vereor,\niudices, ne turpe sit, pre fortissimo viro dicere incipientem\ntimere. Although the general tone of the passage is\nrestrained and subdued, since it is not merely an\nexordium, but the exordium of a man suffering from\nserious anxiety, still something fuller and bolder is\nrequired in the tone, when he says pro fortissiomo viro,\nthan when he says etsi cereor and turpe sit and timere.\nBut his second breath must be more vigorous, partly\nowing to the natural increase of effort, since we\nalways speak our second sentence with less timidity,\nand partly because he indicates the high courage of\nMilo minimeque deceat, cum T. Annius ipse magis de\nrei publicae salute quam de sua perturbetur. Then he\nproceeds to something like a reproof of himself me\nad eius causam parem animi maguitudinem adferre non\nposse. The next clause suggests a reflexion on the\nconduct of others tamen haec novi iudicii nova forma\nterret oculos. And then in what follows he opens\nevery stop, as the saying is qui, quocunque inciderunt,\nconsuetudinem fori et pristinum morem iudiciorum requirunt while the next clause is even fuller and freer\nnon enim corona cousessus vester cinctus est, ut solebat.\nI have called attention to these points to make it\nclear that there is a certain variety, not merely in the delivery of cola, but even in that of phrases consisting of one word, a variety the lack of which\nwould make every word seem of equal importance. The voice, however, must not be pressed beyond\nits powers, for it is liable to be choked and to become less and less clear in proportion to the increase\nof effort, while at times it will break altogether and\nproduce the sound to which the Greeks have given\na name derived from the crowing of cocks before the\nvoice is developed. We must also beware of confusing our utterance by excessive volubility, which\nresults in disregard of punctuation, loss of emotional\npower, and sometimes in the clipping of words. The\nopposite fault is excessive slowness of speech, which\nis a sign of lack of readiness in invention, tends by\nits sluggishness to render our hearers inattentive,\nand, further, wastes the time allotted to us for speaking, a consideration which is of some importance.\nOur speech must be ready, but not precipitate, under\ncontrol, but not slow, while we must not take breath\nso often as to break up our sentence, nor, on the\nother hand, sustain it until it fails us from exhaustion.\nFor the sound produced by loss of breath is disagreeable; we gasp like a drowning man and fill our lungs\nwith long drawn inhalations at in appropriate moments,\ngiving the impression that our action is due not to\nchoice, but to compulsion. Therefore, in attacking\na period of abnormal length, we should collect our\nbreath, but quickly, noiselessly and imperceptibly.\nOn other occasions we shall be able to take breath\nat the natural breaks in the substance of our speech.\nBut we must exercise our breathing capacity to make\nit as great as possible. To produce this result Demosthenes used to recite as many successive lines as possible, while he was climbing a hill. He also, with\na view to securing fluency free from impediment,\nused to roll pebbles under his tongue when speaking\nin the privacy of his study. Sometimes the breath,\nalthough capable of sustained effort and sufficiently\nfull and clear, lacks firmness when exerted, had for\nthat reason is liable to become tremulous, like bodies\nwhich, although to all appearances sound, receive\ninsufficient support from the sinews. This the Greeks\ncall There are some too who, owing to\nthe loss of teeth, do not draw in the breath naturally,\nbut suck it in with a hissing sound. There are\nothers who pant incessantly and so loudly that it\nis perfectly audible within them they remind one\nof heavily-laden beasts of burden straining against\nthe yoke. Some indeed actually affect this mannerism, as though to suggest that they are struggling\nwith the host of ideas that crowd themselves upon\nthem and oppressed by a greater flood of eloquence\nthan their throats are capable of uttering. Others,\nagain, find a difficulty in opening their mouths, and\nseem to struggle with their words; and, further,\nalthough they are not actually faults of the voice,\nyet since they arise out of the use of the voice,\nI think this is the most appropriate place for\nreferring to the habit of coughing and spitting with\nfrequency while speaking, of hawking up phlegm\nfrom the depths of the lungs, like water from a\nwell, sprinkling the nearest of the bystanders with\nsaliva, and expelling the greater portion of the\nbreath through the nostrils. But any of these faults\nare tolerable compared with the practice of chanting\ninstead of speaking, which is the worst feature of\nour modern oratory, whether in the courts or in the schools, and of which I can only say that I do not\nknow whether it is more useless or more repugnant\nto good taste. For what can be less becoming to\nan orator than modulations that recall the stage and\na sing-song utterance which at times resembles the\nmaudlin utterance of drunken revellers What can\nbe more fatal to any emotional appeal than that the\nspeaker should, when the situation calls for grief,\nanger, indignation or pity, not merely avoid the\nexpression of those emotions which require to be\nkindled in the judge, but outrage the dignity of\nthe courts with noises such as are dear to the\nLycians and Carians For Cicero has told us that\nthe rhetoricians of Lycia and Caria come near to\nsinging in their perorations. But, as a matter of tact,\nwe have somewhat overstepped the limits imposed by\nthe more restrained style of singing. I ask you,\ndoes anyone sing, I will not say when his theme is\nmurder, sacrilege or parricide, but at any rate when\nhe deals with figures or accounts, or, to cut a long\nstory short, when he is pleading in any kind of\nlawsuit whatever And if such a form of intonation\nis to be permitted at all, there is really no reason\nwhy the modulations of the voice should not be\naccompanied by harps and flutes, or even by cymbals,\nwhich would be more appropriate to the revolting\nexhibitions of which I am speaking. And yet we\nshow no reluctance in indulging this vicious practice.\nFor no one thinks his own singing hideous, and it\ninvolves less trouble than genuine pleading. There\nare, moreover, some persons who, in thorough conformity with their other vices, are possessed with a\nperpetual passion for hearing something that will\nsoothe their ears. But, it may be urged, does not Cicero himself say that there is a suggestion of\nsinging in the utterance of an orator And is not\nthis the outcome of a natural impulse I shall\nshortly proceed to show to what extent such musical\nmodulations are permissible but if we are to call\nit singing, it must be no more than a suggestion\nof singing, a fact which too many refuse to\nrealise. But it is now high time for me to explain what I\nmean by appropriate delivery. Such appropriateness\nobviously lies in the adaptation of the delivery to\nthe subjects on which we are speaking. This quality\nis, in the main, supplied by the emotions themselves,\nand the voice will ring as passion strikes its chords.\nBut there is a difference between true emotion on\nthe one hand, and false and fictitious emotion on\nthe other. The former breaks out naturally, as in\nthe case of grief, anger or indignation, but lacks\nart, and therefore requires to be formed by methodical\ntraining. The latter, on the other hand, does imply\nart, but lacks the sincerity of nature consequently\nin such cases the main thing is to excite the appropriate feeling in oneself, to form a mental picture\nof the facts, and to exhibit an emotion that cannot\nbe distinguished from the truth. The voice, which\nis the intermediary between ourselves and our\nhearers, will then produce precisely the same\nemotion in the judge that we have put into it. For\nit is the index of the mind, and is capable of expressing all its varieties of feeling. Therefore when we\ndeal with a lively theme, the flow of the voice is\ncharacterised by fullness, simplicity and cheerfulness; but when it is roused to battle, it puts forth\nall its strength and strains every nerve. In anger it is fierce, harsh and intense, and calls for frequent\nfilling of the lungs, since the breath cannot be sustained for long when it is poured forth without\nrestraint. When it is desired to throw odium upon\nour opponents, it will be somewhat slower, since,\nas a rule, it is none save the weaker party takes\nrefuge in such tactics. On the other hand, in flattery,\nadmission, apology or question it will be gentle and\nsubdued. If we advise, warn, promise or console,\nit will be grave and dignified, modest if we express\nfear or shame, bold in exhortation, precise in argument, full of modulations, suggestive of tears and\ndesignedly muffled in appeals for pity, whereas in\ndigression it will be full and flowing, and will have\nall the resonance that is characteristic of confidence;\nin exposition of facts or conversations it will be\neven and pitched half-way betwixt high and low.\nBut it will be raised to express violent emotion, and\nsink when our words are of a calmer nature, rising\nand falling according to the demands of its theme. However, for the moment I will defer speaking\nof the variations in tone required by different topics,\nand will proceed first to the discussion of gesture\nwhich conforms to the voice, and like it, obeys the\nimpulse of the mind. Its importance in oratory is\nsufficiently clear from the fact that there are many\nthings which it can express without the assistance\nof words. For we can indicate our will not merely\nby a gesture of the hands, but also with a nod from\nthe head signs take the place of language in the\ndumb, and the movements of the dance are frequently full of meaning, and appeal to the emotions\nwithout any aid from words. The temper of the\nmind can be inferred from the glance and gait, and even speechless animals show anger, joy, or the\ndesire to please by means of the eye and other\nphysical indications. Nor is it wonderful that gesture which depends on various forms of movement\nshould have such power, when pictures, which are\nsilent and motionless, penetrate into our innermost\nfeelings with such power that at times they seem\nmore eloquent than language itself. On the other\nhand, if gesture and the expression of the face are\nout of harmony with the speech, if we look cheerful\nwhen our words are sad. or slake our heads when\nmaking a positive assertion, our words will not only\nlack weight, but will fail to carry conviction. Gesture and movement are also productive of grace.\nIt was for this reason that Demosthenes used to\npractise his delivery in front of a large mirror, since,\nin spite of the fact that its reflexions are reversed,\nhe trusted his eyes to enable him to judge accurately\nthe effect produced. The head, being the chief member of the body,\nhas a corresponding importance in delivery, serving\nnot merely to produce graceful elect, but to illustrate our meaning as well. To secure grace it is\nessential that the head should be carried naturally\nan erect. For a droop suggests humility, while if\nit be thrown back it seems to express arrogance, if\ninclined to one side it gives an impression of languor,\nwhile if it is held too stiffly and rigidly it appears\nto indicate a rude and savage temper. Further, it\nshould derive appropriate motion from the subject\nof our pleading, maintaining harmony with the gesture and following the movement of the hands and\nside. For the eyes are always turned in the same\ndirection as the gesture, except when we are called upon to condemn or concede something or to express\nabhorrence, when we shall show our aversion by\nturning away the face and by thrusting out our\nhands as though to repel the thought, as in the\nlines or The methods by which the head may express our\nmeaning are manifold. For in addition to those\nmovements which indicate consent, refusal and\naffirmation, there are those expressive of modesty,\nhesitation, wonder or indignation, which are well\nknown and common to all. But to confine the\ngesture to the movement of the head alone is regarded as a fault by those who teach acting as well\nas by professors of rhetoric. Even the frequent\nnodding of the head is not free from fault, while\nto toss or roll it till our hair flies free is suggestive\nof a fanatic. By far the greatest influence is exercised by the\nglance. For it is by this that we express supplication, threats, flattery, sorrow, joy, pride or submission. It is on this that our audience hang, on\nthis that they rivet their attention and their gaze,\neven before we begin to speak. It is this that\ninspires the hearer with affection or dislike, this\nthat conveys a world of meaning and is often more\neloquent than all our words. Consequently in plays\ndestined for the stage, the masters of the art of\ndelivery design even their masks to enhance the\nemotional effect. Thus, in tragedy, Aerope will be sad, Medea fierce, Ajax bewildered, Hercules truculent. In comedy, on the other hand, over and\nabove the methods adopted to distinguish between\nslaves, pimps, parasites, rustics, soldiers, harlots,\nmaidservants, old men stern and mild, youths moral\nor luxurious, married women and girls, we have\nthe important rle of the father who, because at\ntimes he is excited and at others call, has one\neyebrow raised and the other normal, the custom\namong actors being to turn that side of the face to\nthe audience which best suits the role. But of the\nvarious elements that go to form the expression,\nthe eyes are the most important, since they, more\nthan any-thing else, reveal the temper of the mind,\nand without actual movement will twinkle with\nmerriment or be clouded with grief. And further,\nnature has given them tears to serve as interpreters\nof our feelings, tears that will break forth for sorrow\nor stream for very joy. But, when the eyes move,\nthey become intent, indifferent, proud, fierce, mild,\nor angry; and they will assume all these characters\naccording as the pleading may demand. But they\nmust never he fixed or protruding, languid or sluggish, lifeless, lascivious, restless, nor swim with a\nmoist voluptuous glance, nor look aslant nor leer\nin amorous fashion, nor yet must they seem to\npromise or ask a boon. As for keeping them fully\nor partially closed while speaking, surely none save\nan uneducated man or a fool would dream of doing\nsuch a thing. And in addition to all these forms of\nexpression, the upper and lower eyelids can render\nservice in support of the eyes. The eyebrows also\nmay be used with great effect. For to some extent\nthey mould the expression of the eyes and determine that of the forehead. It is by means of the\neyebrows that we contract, raise or smooth the\nlatter in fact, the only thing which has greater\ninfluence over it is the blood, which moves in conformity with the emotions that control the mind,\ncausing a blush on a skin that is sensitive to shame,\nand giving place to an icy pallor under the influence\nof fear, whereas, when it is under control, it produces a peaceful complexion, intermediate between\nthe two. Complete immobility in the eyebrows is\na fault, as also is excess of mobility or the tendency\nto raise one and lower the other, as in the comic\nmask which I mentioned just now while it is a\nfurther blemish if they express a feeling out of\nkeeping with the words we utter. For they show\nanger by contraction, grief by depression and cheerfulness by their expansion. They are also dropped\nor raised to express consent or refusal respectively.\nIt is not often that the lips or nostrils can be\nbecomingly employed to express our feelings, although they are often used to indicate derision,\ncontempt or loathing. For to as Horace says, or blow them out, or twitch them,\nor fret them with our finger, or snort through them\nwith a sudden expulsion of the breath, or stretch\nthem wide or push them up with the flat of the\nhand are all indecorous, since it is not without reason\nthat censure is passed even on blowing the nose too\nfrequently. It is also an ugly habit to protrude the\nlips, open them with a sudden smack, compress\nthem, draw them apart and bare the teeth, or twist\nthem awry to one side till they almost reach the\near, or to curl them in scorn, or let them droop, or\nallow the voice to escape only on one side. It is also unbecoming to lick or bite them, since their\nmotion should be but slight even when they are\nemployed in forming words. For we must speak\nwith the mouth rather than the lips. The neck must be straight, not stiff or bent\nbackward. As regards the throat, contraction and\nstretching are equally unbecoming, though in different ways. If it be stretched, it causes strain\nas well, and weakens and fatigues the voice,\nwhile if the chin be pressed down into the chest\nit makes the voice less distinct and coarsens it,\nowing to the pressure on the windpipe. It is, as a\nrule, unbecoming to raise or contract the shoulders.\nFor it shortens the neck and produces a mean and\nservile gesture, which is even suggestive of dishonesty when men assume an attitude of flattery,\nadmiration or fear. In continuous and flowing passages a most becoming gesture is slightly to extend\nthe arm with shoulders well thrown back and the\nfingers opening as the hand moves forward. But\nwhen we have to speak in specially rich or impressive style, as, for example, in the passage saxa atiqu\nsolitudines voci respondent, the arm will be thrown out\nin a stately sidelong sweep and the words will, as\nit were, expand in unison with the gesture. As\nfor the hands, without which all action would be\ncrippled and enfeebled, it is scarcely possible to\ndescribe the variety of their motions, since they are\nalmost as expressive as words. For other portions\nof the body merely help the speaker, whereas the\nhands may almost be said to speak. Do we not\nuse them to demand, promise, summon, dismiss,\nthreaten, supplicate, express aversion or fear, question\nor deny Do we not employ them to indicate joy, sorrow, hesitation, confession, penitence, measure,\nquantity, number and time Have they not power\nto excite and prohibit, to express approval, wonder\nor shame Do they not take the place of adverbs\nand pronouns when we point at places and things\nIn fact, though the peoples and nations of the earth\nspeak a multitude of tongues, they share in common\nthe universal language of the hands. The gestures of which I have thus far spoken are\nsuch as naturally proceed from us simultaneously\nwith our words. But there are others which indicate things by means of mimicry. For example,\nyou may suggest a sick man by mimicking the\ngesture of a doctor feeling the pulse, or a harpist by\na movement of the hands as though they were\nplucking the strings. But this is a type of gesture\nwhich should be rigorously avoided in pleading. For\nthe orator should be as unlike a dancer as possible,\nand his gesture should be adapted rather to his\nthought than to his actual words, a practice which\nwas indeed once upon a time even adopted by the\nmore dignified performers on the stage. I should,\ntherefore, permit him to direct his hand towards his\nbody to indicate that he is speaking of himself, or to\npoint it at some one else to whom he is alluding,\ntogether with other similar gestures which I need\nnot mention. But, on the other hand, I would not\nallow him to use his hands to imitate attitudes or to\nillustrate anything he may chance to say. And this\nrule applies not merely to the hands, but to all\ngesture and to the voice as well. For in delivering\nthe period stetit soleatus praetor populi Romani, it\nwould be wrong to imitate Verres leaning on his\nmistress, or in uttering the phrase caedebatur in medio foro Messanae to make the side writhe, as it does\nwhen quivering beneath the lash, or to utter shrieks,\nsuch as are extorted by pain. For even comic actors\nseem to me to commit a gross offence against the\ncanons of their art when, if they have in the course\nof some narrative to quote either the words of an old\nman as, for example, in the prologue to the Hydria,\nor of a woman as in the Georgus, they litter them\nin a tremulous or a treble voice, notwithstanding the\nfact that they are playing the part of a young man.\nSo true is it that certain forms of imitation may be\na blemish even in those whose whole art consists in\nimitation. One of the commonest of all the gestures consists\nin placing the middle finger against the thumb and\nextending the remaining three it is suitable to the\nexordum, the hand being moved forward with an\neasy motion a little distance both to right and left,\nwhile the head and shoulders gradually follow the\ndirection of the gesture. It is also useful in the\nstatement of facts, but in that case the hand must be\nmoved with firmness and a little further forward,\nwhile, if we are reproaching or refuting our adversary, the same movement may be employed with\nsome vehemence and energy, since such passages\npermit of greater freedom of extension. On the\nother hand, this same gesture is often directed sideways towards the left shoulder this is a mistake,\nalthough it is a still worse fault to thrust the arm\nacross the chest and gesticulate with the elbow.\nThe middle and third fingers are also sometimes\nturned under the thumb, producing a still more\nforcible effect than the gesture previously described,\nbut not well adapted for use in the exordium or state- meant of facts. But when three fingers are doubled\nunder the thumb, the finger, which Cicero says\nthat Crassus used to such effect, is extended. It is\nused in denunciation and in indication whence its\nname of index finger, while if it be slightly dropped\nafter the hand has been raised toward the shoulder,\nit signifies affirmation, and if pointed as it were\nface downwards toward the ground, it expresses\ninsistence. It is sometimes also used to indicate\nnumber. Again, if its top joint is lightly gripped on\neither side, with the two outer fingers slightly\ncurved, the little finger rather less than the third,\nwe shall have a gesture well suited for argument.\nBut for this purpose the same gesture is rendered\nmore emphatic by holding the middle joint of the\nfinger and contracting the last two fingers still\nfurther to match the lower position of the middle\nfinger and thumb. The following gesture is admirably adapted to accompany modest language the\nthumb and the next three fingers are gently converged to a point and the hand is carried to the\nneighbourhood of the month or chest, then relaxed\npalm downwards and slightly advanced. It was\nwith this gesture that I believe Demosthenes to\nhave commenced the timid and subdued exordium\nof his speech in defence of Ctesiphon, and it was,\nI think, in such a position that Cicero held his\nland, when he said, Slightly greater\nfreedom may be given to the gesture by pointing\nthe fingers down and drawing the hand in towards\nthe body and then opening it somewhat more rapidly\nin the opposite direction, so that it seems as though\nit were delivering our words to the audience. Sometimes we may hold the first two fingers apart without,\nhowever, inserting the thumb between them, the\nremaining two pointing inwards, while even the two\nformer must not be fully extended. Sometimes,\nagain, the third and little finger may be pressed in to\nthe palm near the base of the thumb, which in its\nturn is pressed against the middle joints of the first\nand middle fingers; at others the little finger is\nsometimes drooped obliquely, or the four fingers may\nbe relaxed rather than extended and the thumb\nslanted inwards this last gesture is well adapted to\npointing to one side or marking the different points\nwhich we are making, the had being carried palmupwards to the left and swept back to the right\nface-downwards. The following short gestures are\nalso employed the hand may be slightly hollowed\nas it is when persons are making a vow, and then\nmoved slightly to and fro, the shoulders swaying\ngently in unison this is adapted to passages where\nwe speak with restraint and almost with timidity.\nWonder is best expressed as follows the hand turns\nslightly upwards and the fingers are brought in to\nthe palm, one after the other, beginning with the\nlittle finger; the hand is then opened and turned\nround by a reversal of this motion. There are various\nmethods of expressing interrogation; but, as a rule,\nwe do so by a turn of the hand, the arrangement of\nthe fingers being indifferent. If the first finger\ntouch the middle of the right-hand edge of the\nthumb-nail with its extremity, the other fingers\nbeing relaxed, we shall have a graceful gesture well\nsuited to express approval or to accompany statements\nof facts, and to mark the distinction between our\ndifferent points. There is another gesture not unlike the preceding, in which the remaining three fingers\nare folded it is much employed by the Greeks both\nfor the left hand and the right, in rounding off their\nenthymemes, detail by detail. A gentle movement of\nthe hand expresses promise or assent, a more violent\nmovement suggests exhortation or sometimes praise.\nThere is also that familiar gesture by which we drive\nhome our words, consisting in the rapid opening\nand shutting of the hand but this is a common\nrather than an artistic gesture. Again, there is the\nsomewhat unusual gesture in which the hand is\nhollowed and raised well above the shoulder with a\nmotion suggestive of exhortation. The tremulous\nmotion now generally adopted by foreign schools is,\nhowever, fit only for the stage. I do not know why\nsome persons disapprove of the movement of the\nfingers, with their tops converging, towards the\nmouth. For we do this when we are slightly surprised, and at times also employ it to express fear or\nentreaty when we are seized with sudden indignation.\nFurther, we sometimes clench the hand and press\nit to our breast when we are expressing regret or\nanger, an occasion when it is not unbecoming even\nto force the voice through the teeth in phrases such\nas To point at something with the thumb turned back\nis a gesture which is in general just, but is not, in my\nopinion, becoming to an orator. Motion is generally\ndivided into six kinds, but circular motion must be\nregarded as a seventh. The latter alone is faulty\nwhen applied to gesture. The remaining motions\nthat is, forward, to right or left and up or downall\nhave their significance, but the gesture is never\ndirected to what lies behind us, though we do at times throw the hand back. The best effect is produced by letting the motion of the hand start from\nthe left and end on the right, but this must be done\ngently, the hand sinking to rest and avoiding all\nappearance of giving a blow, although at the end of\na sentence it may sometimes be allowed to drop, but\nmust quickly be raised again or it may occasionally,\nwhen we desire to express wonder or dissent, spring\nback with a rapid motion. In this connexion the earlier instructors in the art\nof gesture rightly added that the movement of the\nhand should begin and end with the thought that is\nexpressed. Otherwise the gesture will anticipate or\nlag behind the voice, both of which produce an\nunpleasing effect. Some, through excess of subtlety,\nhave erroneously prescribed that there should be an\ninterval of three words between each movement;\nbut this rule is never observed, nor can it be. These\npersons, however, were desirous that there should be\nsome standard of speed or slowness a most rational\ndesire, with a view to avoid prolonged inactivity on\nthe part of the hands as well as the opposite fault,\ninto which so many fall, of breaking up the natural\nflow of their delivery by continual motion. There is\nanother still more common error, which is less easy\nof detection. Language possesses certain imperceptible stresses, indeed we might almost call them\nfeet, to which the gesture of most speakers conforms.\nThus there will he one movement at novum crimen,\nanother at Giai Caesar, a third at et ante diem,\na fourth at non auditum, a fifth at propinquus meus, a\nsixth at ad te and others at Quintus Tubero and\ndetulit. From this springs a further error, namely,\nthat young men, when writing out their speeches, devise all their gestures in advance and consider as\nthey compose how the hand is to fall at each\nparticular point. A further unfortunate result is\nthat the movement of the hand, which should end\non the right, frequently finishes on the left. It is\ntherefore better, in view of the fact that all speech\nfalls into a number of brief clauses, at the end of\nwhich we can take breath, if necessary, to arrange\nour gesture to suit these sections. For example, the\nwords novum crimes, Gai Caesar, in a sense form a\nphrase complete in itself, since they are followed by\na conjunction, while the next words, et ante hanc diem\nnon auditum, are also sufficiently self-contained. To\nthese phrases the motions of the hand must be conformed, before the speech has passed beyond the\ncalmness of tone on which it opens. But when increasing warmth of feeling has fired the orator, the\ngesture will become more frequent, in keeping with\nthe impetus of the speech. Some places are best\nsuited by a rapid, and others by a restrained delivery.\nIn the one case we pass rapidly on, fire a volley of\narguments and hurry upon our way; in the other, we\ndrive home our points, force them on the hearer and\nimplant them in his mind. But the slower the\ndelivery, the greater its emotional power thus,\nRosins was rapid and ESOPs weighty in his delivery,\nbecause the former was a comic and the latter a\ntragic actor. The same rule applies to the movemints. Consequently on the stage young men and\nold, soldiers and married women all walk sedately,\nwhile slaves, maidservants, parasites and fishermen\nare more lively in their movements. But instructors\nin the art of gesture will not permit the hand to be\nraised above the level of the eyes or lowered beneath that of the breast; since it is thought a grave blemish\nto lift it to the top of the head or lower it to the lower\nportions of the belly. It may be moved to the left\nwithin the limits of the shoulder, but no further\nwithout loss of decorum. On the other hand, when,\nto express our aversion, we thrust our hand out to\nthe left, the left shoulder must be brought forward\nin unison with the head, which will incline to the\nright. It is never correct to employ the left hand\nalone in gesture, though it will often conform its\nmotion to that of the right, as, for example, when\nwe are counting our arguments on the fingers, or\nturn the palms of the hands to the left to express\nour horror of something, or thrust them out in front\nor spread them out to right and left, or lower them in\napology or supplication though the gesture is not\nthe same in these two cases, or raise them in adoration, or stretch them out in demonstration or invocation, as in the passage, or in the passage from Gracchus etc. For\nin such passages greater emotional effect is produced if both hands co-operate, short gestures being\nbest adapted to matters of small importance and\nthemes of a gentle or melancholy character, and\nlonger gestures to subjects of importance or themes\ncalling for joy or horror. It is desirable also that I should mention the faults\nin the use of the hands, into which even experienced\npleaders are liable to fall. As for the gesture of\ndemanding a cup, threatening a flogging, or indicating\nthe number 500 by crooking the thumb, all of which\nare recorded by writers on the subject, I have never seen them employed even by uneducated rustics.\nBut I know that it is of frequent occurrence for a\nspeaker to expose his side by stretching his arm too\nfar, to be afraid in one case of extending his hand\nbeyond the folds of his cloak, and in another to\nstretch it as far as it will go, to raise it to the roof,\nor by swinging it repeatedly over his left shoulder to\ndeliver such a rain of blows to the rear that it is\nscarcely safe to stand behind him, or to make a circular\nsweep to the left, or by casting out his hand at\nrandom to strike the standers-by or to flap both\nelbows against his sides. There are others, again,\nwhose hands are sluggish or tremulous or inclined to\nsaw the air; sometimes, too, the fingers are crooked\nand brought down with a run from the top of the\nhead, or tossed up into the air with the hand turned\npalm upwards. There is also a gesture, which consists in inclining the head to the right shoulder,\nstretching out the arm from the ear and extending\nthe hand with the thumb turned down. This is a\nspecial favourite with those who boast that they\nspeak To these latter we may\nadd those speakers who hurl quivering epigrams\nwith their fingers or denounce with the hand upraised, or rise on tiptoe, whenever they say something\nof which they are specially proud. This last proceeding may at times be adopted by itself; but they\nconvert it into a blemish by simultaneously raising\none or even two fingers as high as they can reach, or\nheaving up both hands as if they were carrying something. In addition to these faults, there are those\nwhich spring not from nature, but from nervousness,\nsuch as struggling desperately with our lips when\nthey refuse to open, making inarticulate sounds, as though something were sticking in our throat, when\nour memory fails us, or our thoughts will not come\nat our call; rubbing the end of our nose, walking up\nand down in the midst of an unfinished sentence,\nstopping suddenly and courting applause by silence,\nwith many other tricks which it would take too long\nto detail, since everybody has his own particular\nfaults. We must take care not to protrude the chest\nor stomach, since such an altitude arches the back,\nand all bending backwards is unsightly. The flanks\nmust conform to the gesture; for the motion of the\nentire body contributes to the effect indeed, Cicero\nholds that the body is more expressive than even the\nhands. For in the de Orator he says, Slapping the\nthigh, which Clean is said to have been the first to\nintroduce at Athens, is in general use and is becoming\nas a mark of indignation, while it also excites the\naudience. Cicero regrets its absence in Calidius, he complains, With regard to the\nforehead I must beg leave to differ from him for it\nis a purely theatrical trick even to clap the hands or\nbeat the breast. it is only on rare occasions, too,\nthat it is becoming to touch the breast with the\nfinger-tips of the hollowed hand, when, for example,\nwe address ourselves or speak words of exhortation,\nreproach or commiseration. But if ever we do employ\nthis gesture, it will not be unbecoming to pull back\nthe toga at the same time. As regards the feet, we\nneed to be careful about our gait and the attitudes in which we stand. To stand with the right foot\nadvanced or to thrust forward the same foot and\nhand are alike unsightly. At times we may rest our\nweight on the right foot, but without any corresponding inclination of the chest, while, in any case,\nthe gesture is better suited to the comic actor than to\nthe orator. It is also a mistake, when resting on the\nleft foot, to lift the right or poise it on tiptoe. To\nstraddle the feet is ugly if we are standing still, and\nalmost indecent if we are actually moving. To start\nforward may be effective, provided that we move but\na short distance and do so but rarely and without\nviolence. It will also at times be found convenient\nto walk to and fro, owing to the extravagant pauses\nimposed by the plaudits of the audience; Cicero,\nhowever, says that this should be done only on rare\noccasions, and that we should take not more than a\nfew steps. On the other hand, to run up and down,\nwhich, in the ease of Manlius Sure, Domitius Afer\ncalled overdoing it, is sheer folly, and there was no\nlittle wit in the question put by Virginias Flatus to\na rival professor, when he asked how many miles he\nhad declaimed. I know, too, that some authorities\nwarn us not to walk with our backs turned to the\njudges, but to move diagonally and keep our eyes\nfixed on the panel. This cannot be done in private\ntrials, but in such cases the space available is small\nand the time during which our backs are turned is of\nthe briefest. On the other hand, we are permitted\nat times to walk backwards gradually. Some even\njump backwards, which is merely ludicrous. Stamping the foot is, as Cicero says, effective when done\non suitable occasions, that is to say, at the commence\nmeant or close of a lively argument, but if it be frequently indulged in, it brands the speaker as a\nfool and ceases to attract the attention of the judge.\nThere is also the unsightly habit of swaying to right\nand left, and shifting the weight from one foot to\nthe other. Above all, we must avoid effeminate\nmovements, such as Cicero ascribes to Titus, a circumstance which led to a certain kind of dance being\nnicknamed Titus. Another reprehensible practice\nis that of nodding frequently and rapidly to either\nside, a mannerism for which the elder Curio was derided by Julius, who asked who it was who was speaking in a boat, while on another occasion, when Curio\nhad been tossing himself about in his usual manner,\nwhile Octaves, his colleague, was sitting beside him\nbandaged and reeking with medicaments on account\nof ill-health, Spiciness remarked, The shoulders also\nare apt to be jerked to and fro, a fault of which\nDemosthenes is said to have cured himself by\nspeaking on a narrow platform with a spear hanging\nimmediately above his shoulder, in order that, if in\nthe heat of his eloquence he failed to avoid this\nfault, he might have his attention called to the\nfact by a prick from the spear. The only condition\nthat justifies our walking about while speaking is\nif we are pleading in a public trial before a large\nnumber of judges and desire specially to impress our\narguments upon them individually. The practice\nadopted by some of throwing the toga back over the\nshoulder, while they draw up the fold to their waist\nwith the right hand, and use the left for gesticulation\nas they walk up and down and discourse, is not to be tolerated; for even to draw back the left hand\nwhile extending the right is an objectionable habit.\nThis reminds me of an extremely foolish trick, which\nI think I ought to mention, that some speakers have\nof employing the intervals when the audience are\napplauding by whispering in someone's ear or jesting\nwith their friends or looking back at their clerks, as\nif telling them to make a note of some gratuity to\nbe dispensed to their supporters. On the other\nhand, when we are making some explanation to the\njudge, more especially if the point be somewhat\nobscure, a slight inclination in his direction will be\nnot unbecoming. But to lean forward towards the\nadvocate seated on the benches of our opponent is\noffensive, while, unless we are genuinely fatigued, it\nis a piece of affectation to lean back among our own\nfriends and to be supported in their arms; the same\nremark also applies to the practice of being prompted\naloud or reading from manuscript as though uncertain of our memory. For all these mannerisms impair the force of our speaking, chill the\neffect of emotional appeals and make the judge\nthink that he is not being treated with sufficient\nrespect. To cross over to the seats of our opponents\nborders on impudence, and Cassius Severus showed\na neat turn of wit when he demanded that a barrier\nmight be erected between himself and an opponent\nwho behaved in this fashion. Moreover, though to\nadvance towards our opponent may at times produce\nan impression of passionate energy, the return to\nour former position will always prove correspondingly\ntame. Many of the rules which I have given will\nrequire modification by those who have to plead\nbefore judges seated on a dais. For in such cases the face must be raised somewhat higher, so\nthat the speaker's eyes may be fixed on the president\nof the court for the same reason his gestures must\nalso be carried a little higher, while there are other\ndetails which will readily occur to my reader without\nany mention from me. Similar modifications will\nbe likewise necessary for those who plead sitting.\nFor this is done, as a rule, only in cases of minor\nimportance, where delivery will necessarily be more\nrestrained, and certain defects are inevitable. For\nexample, when the speaker sits on the left side of the\njudge, he will have to advance his right foot, while\nif he be seated on the right, many of his gestures\nmust be made from right to left, in order that they\nmay be addressed to the judge. Personally, I note\nthat many speakers start up at the conclusion of\nindividual periods, while some proceed to walk to\nand fro for a little it is for them to decide whether\nthis is becoming or not I will merely remark that,\nwhen they do this, they are not pleading seated.\nIt was a common custom, which has not entirely\ndisappeared, to drink or even to eat while pleading;\nbut I shall not permit my ideal orator to do anything\nof the kind. For if a man cannot endure the\nburdens imposed by oratory without having recourse\nto such remedies, he should not find it a serious\nhardship to give up pleading altogether, a course\nwhich is far preferable to acknowledging his contempt\nboth for his profession and his audience. With regard to dress, there is no special garb\npeculiar to the orator, but his dress comes more\nunder the public eye than that of other men. It\nshould, therefore, be distinguished and manly, as,\nindeed, it ought to be with all men of position. For excessive care with regard to the cut of the toga,\nthe style of the shoes, or the arrangement of the\nhair, is just as reprehensible as excessive carelessness. There are also details of dress which are\naltered to some extent by successive changes in\nfashion. The ancients, for example, wore no folds,\nand their successors wore them very short. Consequently it follows that in view of the fact that their\narms were, like those of the Greeks, covered by the\ngarment, they must have employed a different form of\ngesture in the exordium from that which is now in\nuse. However, I am speaking of our own day. The\nspeaker who has not the right to wear the broad\nstripe, will wear his girdle in such a way that the\nfront edges of the tunic fall a little below his knees,\nwhile the edges in rear reach to the middle of his\nhams. For only women draw them lower and only\ncenturions higher. If we wear the purple stripe, it\nrequires but little care to see that it fills becomingly;\nnegligence in this respect sometimes excites criticism. Among those who wear the broad stripe, it is\nthe fashion to let it hang somewhat lower than in\ngarments that are retained by the girdle. The toga\nitself should, in my opinion, be round, and cut to\nfit, otherwise there are a number of ways in which it\nmay be unshapely. Its front edge should by preference reach to the middle of the shin, while tie back\nshould be higher in proposition as the girdle is higher behind than in front. The fold is most becoming,\nif it fall to a point a little above the lower edge of\nthe tunic, and should certainly never fall below it.\nThe other fold which passes obliquely like a belt\nunder the right shoulder and over the left, should\nneither be too tight nor too loose. The portion of\nthe toga which is last to be arranged should fall\nrather low, since it will sit better thus and be\nkept in its place. A portion of the tunic also should\nbe drawn back in order that it may not fall over the\narm when we are pleading, and the fold should be\nthrown over the shoulder, while it will not be\nunbecoming if the edge be turned back. On the\nother hand, we should not cover the shoulder and\nthe whole of the throat, otherwise our dress will be\nunduly narrowed and will lose the impressive effect\nproduced by breadth at the chest. Tire left arm\nshould only be raised so far as to form a right angle\nat the elbow, while the edge of the toga should fall\nin equal lengths on either side. The hand should\nnot be overloaded with rings, which should under no\ncircumstances encroach upon the middle joint of\nthe finger. The most becoming attitude for the\nhand is produced by raising the thumb and slightly\ncurving the fingers, unless it is occupied with holding manuscript. But we should not go out of our\nway to carry the latter, for it suggests an acknowledgement that we do not trust our memory, and is\na hindrance to a number of gestures. The ancients\nused to let the toga fall to the heels, as the Greeks\nare in the habit of doing with the cloak Plotius\nand Nigidius both recommend this in the books\nwhich they wrote about gesture as practised in\ntheir own day. I am consequently all the more surprised at the view expressed by so learned a\nman as Plinius Secundus, especially since it occurs\nin a book which carries minute research almost to\nexcess for he asserts that Cicero was in the\nhabit of wearing his toga in such a fashion to conceal his varicose veins, despite the fact that this\nfashion is to be seen in the statues of persons who\nlived after Cicero's day. As regards the short cloak,\nbandages used to protect the legs, mufflers and\ncoverings for the ears, nothing short of ill-health\ncan excuse their use. But such attention to our dress is only possible at\nthe beginning of a speech, since, as the pleading\ndevelops, in fact, almost from the beginning of the\nstatement of facts, the fold will slip down from the\nshoulder quite naturally and as it were of its own\naccord, while when we come to arguments and\ncommonplaces, it will be found convenient to throw\nback the toga from the left shoulder, and even to\nthrow down the fold if it should stick. The left\nhand may be employed to pluck the toga from the\nthroat and the upper portion of the chest, for by\nnow the whole body will be hot. And just as at\nthis point the voice becomes more vehement and\nmore varied in its utterance, so the clothing begins\nto assume something of a combative pose. Consequently, although to wrap the toga round the left\nhand or to pull it about us as a girdle would be\nalmost a symptom of madness, while to throw back\nthe fold from its bottom over the right shoulder\nwould be a foppish and effeminate gesture, and\nthere are yet worse effects than these, there is, at\nany rate, no reason why we should not place the\nlooser portions of the fold under the left arm, since it gives an air of vigour and freedom not ill-suited\nto the warmth and energy of our action. When,\nhowever, our speech draws near its close, more\nespecially if fortune shows herself kind, practically\neverything is becoming; we may stream with sweat,\nshow signs of fatigue, and let our dress fall in careless disorder and the toga slip loose from us on\nevery side. This fact makes me all the more surprised that Pliny should think it worth while to\nenjoin the orator to dry his brow with a handkerchief in such a way as not to disorder the hair,\nalthough a little later he most properly, and with a\ncertain gravity and sternness of language, forbids\nus to rearrange it. For my own part, I feel that\ndishevelled locks make an additional appeal to the\nemotions, and that neglect of such precautions\ncreates a pleasing impression. On the other hand,\nif the toga falls down at the beginning of our\nspeech, or when we have only proceeded but a little\nway, the failure to replace it is a sign of indifference,\nor sloth, or sheer ignorance of the way in which\nclothes should be worn. The above are the chief adornments and faults\nof delivery. But there are a number of further\nconsiderations which the orator must bear in mind.\nIn the first place there is the question as to the\ncharacter of speaker, judges and audience. For\njust as the methods of speaking may justifiably be\nvaried to suit the characteristics of different orators\nand different judges, so it is with delivery. The\nsame characteristics of voice, gesture and gait are\nnot equally becoming in the presence of the\nemperor, the senate, the people, and magistrates,\nor in private and public trials, or in making a request to the praetor for the appointment of a judge\nto hear our case, and in actual pleading. Anyone\nwho will reflect upon the matter will realise the\nnature of the differences involved, as he will also be\nable to realise the nature of the subject on which\nhe is speaking and the effect which he desires to\nproduce. The considerations with regard to the\nsubject are four in number, of which the first has\nreference to the case as a whole. For the case may\nbe of a gloomy or a cheerful nature, an anxious\nbusiness, or one that calls for no alarm, and may\ninvolve issues of great or trivial importance. We\nought, therefore, never to be so preoccupied over\nparticular portions of a case as to forget to consider\nthe case as a whole. The second point is concerned\nwith the different aspects of the various portions of\nthe speech, that is, the exordium, statement of facts,\narguments and peroration. The third concerns the\nthoughts, which will vary according to the subject\nmatter and the emotions which we require to\nawaken. The fourth has reference to the words,\nwhich must be given appropriate expression, unless\ntheir force is to be entirely wasted, although it is an\nerror to attempt to make our delivery reproduce the\nsense of every single word. Consequently, in panegyric, funeral orations excepted, in returning thanks,\nexhortations and the like, the delivery must be\nluxuriant, magnificent, and grand. On the other\nhand, in funeral or consolatory speeches, together\nwith most of those in defence of accused persons,\nthe delivery will be melancholy and subdued.\nWhen we speak in the senate, it will be authoritative, when we address the people, dignified, and\nwhen we are pleading in private cases, restrained. As regards the respective portions of speeches,\nthoughts and words, I must speak at somewhat\ngreater length, as the problems involved are manifold. There are three qualities which delivery should\npossess. It should be conciliatory, persuasive and\nmoving, and the possession of these three qualities\ninvolves charm as a further requisite. A conciliatory\neffect may be secured either by charm of style or\nby producing an impression of excellence of character,\nwhich is in some mysterious way clearly revealed\nboth by voice and gesture. A persuasive effect, on\nthe other hand, is produced by the power of assertion,\nwhich is sometimes more convincing even than actual\nproof. says Cicero to\nCalidius, And again, We must therefore reveal both\nconfidence and firmness, above all, if we have the\nrequisite authority to back them. The method of\narousing the emotions depends on our power to\nrepresent or imitate the passions. Therefore when\nthe judge in private, or the usher in public cases,\ncalls upon us to speak, we must rise with deliberation.\nWe shall then, to make our garb the more becoming,\nand to secure a moment for reflexion, devote a brief\nspace to the arrangement of our toga or even, if\nnecessary, to throwing it on afresh; but it must\nbe borne in mind that this injunction applies only\nto cases in the courts; for we must not do this if\nwe are speaking before the emperor or a magistrate,\nor in cases where the judge sits in a position of\nsuperior authority. Even when we turn to the judge, and have requested and received the praetor's permission to address the court, we must not break forth\nat once into speech, but should allow ourselves a few\nmoments for reflexion. For the display of such care\non the part of one who is about to speak attracts the\naudience and gives the judge time to settle down.\nHomer inculcates this practice by placing before\nus the example of Ulysses, whom he describes as\nhaving stood for a while with eyes fixed on the\nground and staff held motionless, before he poured\nforth his whirlwind of eloquence. In this preliminary\ndelay there are certain pauses, as the actors call\nthem, which are not unbecoming. We may stroke\nour head, look at our hand, wring the fingers, pretend to summon all our energies for the effort,\nconfess to nervousness by a deep sigh, or may adopt\nany other method suited to our individual character,\nwhile these proceedings may be extended over some\ntime, if we find that the judge is not yet giving us\nhis attention. Our attitude should be upright, our\nfeet level and a slight distance apart, or the left may\nbe very slightly advanced. The knees should be\nupright, but not stiff; the shoulders relaxed, the face\nstern, but not sad, expressionless or languid the\narms should be held slightly away from the side,\nthe left hand being in the position described above,\nwhile the right, at the moment when our speech\nbegins, should be slightly extended beyond the fold\nof the toga with the most modest of gestures, as\nthough waiting for the commencement. For it is\na mistake to look at the ceiling, to rub the face and\ngive it a flush of impudence, to crane it boldly forward, to frown in order to secure a fierce expression,\nor brush back the hair from the forehead against its natural direction in order to produce a terrifying\neffect by making it stand on end. Again, there are\nother unseemly tricks, such as that so dear to the\nGreeks of twitching our fingers and lips as though\nstudying what to say, clearing the throat with a\nloud noise, thrusting out one foot to a considerable\ndistance, grasping a portion of the toga in the left\nhand, standing with feet wide apart, holding ourselves\nstiffly, leaning backwards, stooping, or bunching our\nshoulders toward the back of the head, as wrestlers\ndo when about to engage. A gentle delivery is most often best suited to the\nexordium. For there is nothing better calculated\nthan modesty to win the good-will of the judge,\nalthough there are exceptions to the rule, since, as I\nhave already pointed out, all exordia are not delivered\nin the same manner. But, generally speaking, a\nquiet voice, a modest gesture, a toga sitting well\nupon the shoulder, and a gentle motion of the sides\nto right and left, accompanied by a corresponding\nmovement of the eyes, will all be found to produce\na becoming effect. In the statement of facts the hand\nshould on most occasions be further extended, the\ntoga allowed to slip back, the gestures sharply distinguished and the voice colloquial, but slightly more\nemphatic, while there should also be uniformity of\ntone. Such, at any rate, should be the delivery of\na passage such as the following or But different methods may be\ncalled for in this same portion of the speech, in\npassionate utterances such as, or in pathetic passages such as, The proofs, however,\nrequire the utmost variety of delivery. For to state\nthem and distinguish between their various points,\nand to examine witnesses, we employ something not\nfar removed from a colloquial tone, as is also the case\nin anticipating objections, which is really another\nform of statement. But in all these cases we sometimes deride, and sometimes mimic our opponents.\nArgument, being as a rule of a livelier, more energetic\nand aggressive character, demands a type of gesture\nadapted to its style, that is to say, it should be bold\nand rapid. There are certain portions of our arguments that require to be pressed home with energy,\nand in these our style must be compact and concentrated. Digressions, as a rule, are characterised by\ngentleness, calm and placidity, as, for example, in\nCicero's description of the Rape of Proserpine, his\npicture of Sicily, or his panegyric of Pompey. For\nnaturally passages which deal with subjects lying\noutside the main question in dispute demand a less\ncombative tone. There are occasions on which we\nmay adopt a gentle manner in depreciating our\nopponents by giving a picture of their character, as\nin the following passage Under such circumstances we\nmay even allow the gesture to match the voice, and\nmay employ a gentle movement from side to side\nbut this motion should be confined to the hands, and\nthere should be no movement of the flanks. There\nare a number of gradations of tone which may be employed to kindle the feeling of the judges. The\nmost vehement tones that an orator is ever called\nupon to use will be employed in passages such as\nthe following For he has just said On the other hand, a lower tone, not devoid\nof a certain charm, should be employed in passages\nsuch as But the utterance must be fuller,\nslower, and consequently sweeter, when the orator\nsays, In this passage every sound should e drawn out,\nwe should dwell upon the vowel-sounds and speak\nfill-throated. Still fuller should be the stream of our\nvoice in the invocation, ; while a tone not far removed from chanting,\nand dying away to a cadence, should be employed in\ndelivering the phrase, These are the modulations denounced\nby Demosthenes and Aeschines, but they do not\nnecessarily for that reason merit our disapprobation.\nFor as each of these orators taunts the other with\nmaking use of them, it is clear that they were employed\nby both. We may be sure that Demosthenes did not\nrestrict himself to his ordinary simplicity of tone when\nhe swore by those that fought for their country at\nMarathon, Plataea and Salamis, nor did Aeschines\nemploy a colloquial utterance when he lamented for\nthe fate of Thebes. There is also an entirely different\ntone, which might be described as lying almost outside the range of the instrument. The Greeks\ncall it bitterness, and it consists in an extravagant\nacerbity almost beyond the compass of the human\nvoice. It is employed in passages such as, But the extravagance of which I spoke will come\nin at the opening, where the orator cries, The peroration, if it involves a recapitulation,\nrequires an even utterance of short, clear-cut\nclauses. If, on the other hand, it is designed to\nstir the emotions of the judges, it will demand\nsome of the qualities already mentioned. If it aims\nat soothing them, it should How softly; if it is to\nrouse them to pity, the voice must be delicately\nmodulated to a melancholy sweetness, which is at\nonce most natural and specially adapted to touch\nthe heart. For it may be noted that even orphans\nand widows have a certain musical quality in the\nlamentations which they utter at funerals. A\nmuffled voice, such as Cicero says was possessed\nby Antonius, will also be exceedingly effective under\nsuch circumstances, since it has just the natural\ntone which we seek to imitate. Appeals to pity\nare, however, of two kinds they may be marked\nby an admixture of indignation, as in the passage\njust quoted describing the condemnation of Philodamus, or they may be coupled with appeals for\nmercy, in which case their tone will be more subdued. Therefore although there is a suggestion of\nthe chanting tone in the delivery of such passages\nas for he did\nnot utter these words in a contentious tone, or in for he did not say this\nas though he were appealing to them or calling them\nto witness, the ensuing phrases require infinitely\ngreater modulation and longer-drawn harmonies and and or when he offers to sell the property of\nGaius Rabirius at one sesterce, Again,\nit is a most effective device to confess in the peroration\nthat the strain of grief and fatigue is overpowering,\nand that our strength is sinking beneath them, as\nCicero does in his defence of Milo And\nin such passages our delivery must conform to our\nwords. It may be thought that there are other points\nwhich should be mentioned in connexion with the\nduties of the orator in this portion of his speech, such\nas calling forward the accused, lifting up his children\nfor the court to see, producing his kinsfolk, and\nrending his garments; but they have been dealt\nwith in their proper place. Such being the variety entailed by the different\nportions of our pleading, it is sufficiently clear that\nour delivery must be adapted to our matter, as I\nhave already shown, and sometimes also, though\nnot always conform to our actual words, as I have\njust remarked. For instance, must not the words, be\nuttered in a low, subdued tone, whereas, is a phrase requiring a strong and energetic utterance For\nsuch conformity gives a force and appropriateness\nto our matter, and without it the expression of\nthe voice will be out of harmony with our thought.\nAgain, what of the fact that a change of delivery\nmay make precisely the same words either demonstrate or affirm, express reproach, denial, wonder or\nindignation, interrogation, mockery or depreciation\nFor the word is given a different expression\nin each of the following passages and and and To cut a long matter short, if my reader will take\nthis or any other word he chooses and run it through\nthe whole gamut of emotional expression, he will\nrealise the truth of what I say. There is one further remark which I must add,\nnamely, that while what is becoming is the main\nconsideration in delivery, different methods will often\nsuit different speakers. For this is determined by\na principle which, though it is obscure and can\nhardly be expressed in words, none the less\nexists and, though it is a true saying that none the\nless, despite the fact that such success cannot be attained without art, it is impossible entirely to communicate the secret by the rules of art. There are\nsome persons in whom positive excellences have no\ncharm, while there are others whose very faults give\npleasure. We have seen the greatest of comic actors,\nDemetrius and Stratocles, win their success by\nentirely different merits. But that is the less\nsurprising owing to the fact that the one was at his\nbest in the rles of gods, young men, good fathers\nand slaves, matrons and respectable old women,\nwhile the other excelled in the portrayal of sharptempered old men, cunning slaves, parasites, pimps\nand all the more lively characters of comedy. For\ntheir natural gifts differed. For Demetrius' voice,\nlike his other qualities, had greater charm, while\nthat of Stratocles was the more powerful. But\nyet more noticeable were the incommunicable\npeculiarities of their action. Demetrius showed\nunique gifts in the movements of his hands, in\nhis power to charm his audience by the longdrawn sweetness of his exclamations, the skill with\nwhich he would make his dress seem to puff out\nwith wind as he walked, and the expressive movements of the right side which he sometimes introduced with effect, in all of which things he was\nhelped by his stature and personal beauty. On the\nother hand, Stratocles' forte lay in his nimbleness\nand rapidity of movement, in his laugh which,\nthough not always in keeping with the character\nlie represented, he deliberately employed to awaken\nanswering laughter in his audience, and finally, even\nin the way in which he sank his neck into his\nshoulders. If either of these actors had attempted\nany of his rival's tricks, he would have produced a most unbecoming effect. Consequently, every man\nmust get to know his own peculiarities and must\nconsult not merely the general rules of technique,\nbut his own nature as well with a view to forming\nhis delivery. But there is no law of heaven which\nprohibits the possession of all or at any rate the\nmajority of styles by one and the same person. I\nmust conclude this topic with a remark which applies\nto all my other topics as well, that the prime essential\nis a sense of proportion. For I am not trying to\nform a comic actor, but an orator. Consequently,\nwe need not study all the details of gesture nor, as\nregards our speaking, be pedantic in the use we\nmake of the rules governing punctuation, rhythm\nand appeals to the emotions. For example, if an\nactor has to speak the following lines on the stage he will hesitate as in doubt, will vary the modulations\nof his voice, together with the movements of hand\nand head. But oratory has a different flavour and\nobjects to elaborate condiments, since it consists in\nserious pleading, not in mimicry. There is, therefore, good reason for the condemnation passed on a\ndelivery which entails the continual alteration of\nfacial expression, annoying restlessness of gesture\nand gusty changes of tone. And it was a wise saying\nthat the ancient orators borrowed from the Greeks,\nas is recorded by Popilius Laenas, to the effect that\nthere is too much in such delivery. The\ninstructions given by Cicero on this subject, as on all\nothers, are quite admirable; I allude to the passages which I have already quoted from his Orator, while\nthere are similar observations in the Brutus with\nreference to Marcus Antonius. But to-day a rather\nmore violent form of delivery has come into fashion\nand is demanded of our orators it is well adapted to\ncertain portions of a speech, but requires to be kept\nunder control. Otherwise, in our attempt to ape\nthe elegances of the stage, we shall lose the authority\nwhich should characterise the man of dignity and\nvirtue. I now come to what is by far the most arduous\nportion of the task which I have set myself to perform. Indeed had I fully realised the difficulties\nwhen I first designed this work, I should have considered betimes whether my strength was sufficient to\nsupport the load that now weighs upon me so heavily.\nBut to begin with, I felt how shameful it would be\nto fail to perform what I had promised, and later,\ndespite the fact that my labour became more and\nmore arduous at almost every stage, the fear of\nstultifying what I had already written sustained my\ncourage through every difficulty. Consequently\neven now, though the burden that oppresses me is\ngreater than ever, the end is in sight and I am\nresolved to faint by the wayside rather than despair.\nBut the fact that I began with comparatively trivial\ndetails deceived me. Subsequently I was lured still\nfurther on my voyage by the temptations of the\nfavouring breeze that filled my sails; but the rules\nwhich I was then concerned to give were still of a\nfamiliar kind and had been already treated by most\nwriters of rhetorical textbooks thus far I seemed to\nmyself to be still in sight of shore and I had the\ncompany of many who had ventured to entrust themselves to the self-same winds. But presently when\nI entered on the task of setting forth a theory of eloquence which had been but newly discovered and\nrarely essayed, I found but few that had ventured so\nfar from harbour. And finally now that the ideal\norator, whom it was my design to mould, has been\ndismissed by his masters and is either proceeding\non his way borne onward by his own impetus, or\nseeking still mightier assistance from the innermost\nshrine of wisdom, I begin to feel how far I have\nbeen swept into the great deep. Now there is One only can I discern in all the boundless waste of\nwaters, Marcus Tullius Cicero, and even he, though\nthe ship in which he entered these seas is of such\nsize and so well found, begins to lessen sail and to\nrow a slower stroke, and is content to speak merely\nof the kind of speech to be employed by the perfect\norator. But my temerity is such that I shall essay to\nform my orator's character and to teach him his duties.\nThus I have no predecessor to guide my steps and\nmust press far, far on, as my theme may demand.\nStill an honourable ambition is always deserving of\napproval, and it is all the less hazardous to dare\ngreatly, when forgiveness is assured us if we fail. The question of the to be\nadopted remains to be discussed. This was described\nin my original division of my subject as forming its\nthird portion for I promised that I would speak of\nthe art, the artist and the work. But since oratory\nis the work both of rhetoric and of the orator, and\nsince it has many forms, as I shall show, the art and\nthe artist are involved in the consideration of all\nthese forms. But they differ greatly from one\nanother, and not merely in species, as statue differs\nfrom statue, picture from picture and speech from\nspeech, but in genus as well, as, for example,\nEtruscan statues differ from Greek and Asiatic\norators from Attic. But these different kinds of\nwork, of which I speak, are not merely the product\nof different authors, but have each their own following of admirers, with the result that the perfect\norator has not yet been found, a statement which\nperhaps may be extended to all arts, not merely\nbecause some qualities are more evident in some\nartists than in others, but because one single form will not satisfy all critics, a fact which is due in\npart to conditions of time or place, in part to the\ntaste and ideals of individuals. The first great painters, whose works deserve\ninspection for something more than their mere\nantiquity, are said to have been Polygnotus and\nAglaopllon, whose simple colouring has still such\nenthusiastic admirers that they prefer these almost\nprimitive works, which may be regarded as the first\nfoundations of the art that was to be, over the works\nof the greatest of their successors, their motive\nbeing, in my opinion, an ostentatious desire to seem\npersons of superior taste. Later Zeuxis and Parrhasius contributed much to the progress of painting.\nThese artists were separated by no great distance of\ntime, since both flourished about the period of the\nPeloponnesian war for example, Xenophon has\npreserved a conversation between Socrates and\nParrhasius. The first-mentioned seems to have\ndiscovered the method of representing light and\nshade, while the latter is said to have devoted\nspecial attention to the treatment of line. For\nZeuxis emphasised the limbs of the human body,\nthinking thereby to add dignity and grandeur to\nhis style it is generally supposed that in this he\nfollowed the example of Homer, who likes to\nrepresent even his female characters as being of\nheroic mould. Parrhasius, on the other hand, was\nso fine a draughtsman that he has been styled the\nlaw-giver of his art, on the ground that all other\nartists take his representations of gods and heroes as\nmodels, as though no other course were possible.\nIt was, however, from about the period of the reign\nof Philip down to that of the successors of Alexander that painting flourished more especially, although\nthe different artists are distinguished for different\nexcellences. Protogenes, for example, was renowned\nfor accuracy, Pamphilus and Melanthius for soundness of taste, Antiphilus for facility, Theon of Samos\nfor his depiction of imaginary scenes, known as and Apelles for genius and grace, in the\nlatter of which qualities he took especial pride.\nEuphranor, on the other hand, was admired on the\nground that, while he ranked with the most eminent\nmasters of other arts, he at the same time achieved\nmarvellous skill in the arts of sculpture and painting. The same differences exist between sculptors. The\nart of Callon and Hegesias is somewhat rude and\nrecalls the Etruscans, but the work of Calamis has\nalready begun to be less stiff, while Myron's statues\nshow a greater softness of form than had been\nachieved by the artists just mentioned. Polyclitus\nsurpassed all others for care and grace, but although\nthe majority of critics account him as the greatest\nof sculptors, to avoid making him faultless they\nexpress the opinion that his work is lacking in\ngrandeur. For while he gave the human form an\nideal grace, he is thought to have been less successful in representing the dignity of the gods. he is\nfurther alleged to have shrunk from representing\npersons of maturer years, and to have ventured on\nnothing more difficult than a smooth and beardless\nface. But the qualities lacking in Polyclitus are\nallowed to have been possessed by Phidias and\nAlcamenes. On the other hand, Phidias is regarded\nas more gifted in his representation of gods than of\nmen, and indeed for chryselephantine statues he is\nwithout a peer, as he would in truth be, even if he had produced nothing in this material beyond his\nMinerva at Athens and his Jupiter at Olympia in\nElis, whose beauty is such that it is said to have\nadded something even to the awe with which the\ngod was already regarded so perfectly did the\nmajesty of the work give the impression of godhead.\nLysippus and Praxiteles are asserted to be supreme\nas regards faithfulness to nature. For Demetrius is\nblamed for carrying realism too far, and is less\nconcerned about the beauty than the truth of his\nwork. Now, if we turn our attention to the various styles\nof oratory, we shall find almost as great variety of\ntalents as there are of personal appearance. There\nwere certain kinds of oratory which, owing to the\ncircumstances of the age, suffered from lack of polish,\nalthough in other respects they displayed remarkable\ngenius. In this class we may place orators such as\nLaelius, Africanus, Cato, and even the Gracchi,\nwhom we may call the and of oratory. Among orators of the intermediate\ntype we may rank Lucius Crassus and Quintus\nHortensius. Then let us turn to a vast harvest of\norators who flourished much about the same period.\nIt is here that we find the vigour of Caesar, the\nnatural talent of Caelius, the subtlety of Calidius,\nthe accuracy of Pollio, the dignity of Messala, the\nausterity of Calvus, the gravity of Brutus, the acumen\nof Sulpicius and the bitterness of Cassius, while\namong those whom we have seen ourselves we\nadmire the fluency of Seneca, the strength of Africanus, the mellowness of Afer, the charm of Crispus,\nthe sonority of Trachalus and the elegance of Secundus. But in Cicero we have one who is not, like Euphranor, merely distinguished in a number\nof different forms of art, but is supreme in all the\ndifferent qualities which are praised in each individual\norator. And yet even his own contemporaries\nventured to attack him on the ground that he was\nbombastic, Asiatic, redundant, given to excessive\nrepetition, liable at times to be pointless in his\nwitticisms, sensuous, extravagant and an outrageous\naccusation almost effeminate in his rhythm. And\nlater, after he had fallen a victim to the proscription of the second triumvirate, those who hated\nand envied him and regarded him as their rival, nay,\neven those who had flattered him in the days of his\npower, attacked him now that he could no longer\nreply. But that very man, who is now regarded\nby some as being too jejune and dry, was attacked\nby his personal enemies on no other ground than\nthat his style was too florid and his talents too little\nunder control. Both charges are false, but there is\nmore colour for the he in the latter case than in\nthe former. Those, however, who criticised him\nmost severely were the speakers who desired to be\nregarded as the imitators of Attic oratory. This\ncoterie, regarding themselves as the sole initiates in\nthe mysteries of their art, assailed him as an alien,\nindifferent to their superstitions and refusing to be\nbound by their laws. Their descendants are among\nus to-day, a withered, sapless and anemic band.\nFor it is they that flaunt their weakness under the\nname of health, in defiance of the actual truth, and\nbecause they cannot endure the dazzling rays of the\nsun of eloquence, hide themselves beneath the\nshadow of a mighty name. However, as Cicero himself answered them at length and in a number of passages, it will be safer for me to be brief in my\ntreatment of this topic. The distinction between the Attic and the Asiatic\nschools takes us back to antiquity. The former were\nregarded as concise and healthy, the latter as empty\nand inflated the former were remarkable for the\nabsence of all superfluity, while the latter were\ndeficient alike in taste and restraint. The reason\nfor this division, according to some authorities,\namong them Santra, is to be found in the fact that,\nas Greek gradually extended its range into the\nneighbouring cities of Asia, there arose a class of\nmen who desired to distinguish themselves as orators\nbefore they had acquired sufficient command of the\nlanguage, and who consequently began to express\nby periphrases what could have been expressed\ndirectly, until finally this practice became an ingrained habit. My own view, however, is that the\ndifference between the two styles is attributable to\nthe character both of the orators and the audiences\nwhom they addressed the Athenians, with their\npolish and refinement, refused to tolerate emptiness\nand redundance, while the Asiatics, being naturally\ngiven to bombast and ostentation, were puffed up\nwith a passion for a more vainglorious style of\neloquence. At a later period, the critics, to whom\nwe owe this classification, added a third style, the\nRhodian, which they asserted to he midway between\nthe two and to be a blend of both, since the orators\nof this school are neither so concise as the Attic nor\nredundant like the Asiatic school, but appear to\nderive their style in part from their national characteristics, in part from those of their founder. For\nit was Aeschines who introduced the culture of Athens at Rhodes, which he had chosen as his place\nof exile and just as certain plants degenerate as a\nresult of change of soil and climate, so the fine Attic\nflavour was marred by the admixture of foreign\ningredients. Consequently certain of the orators of\nthis school are regarded as somewhat slow and\nlacking in energy, though not devoid of a certain\nweight, and as resembling placid pools rather than\nthe limpid springs of Athens or the turbid torrents\nof Asia. No one therefore should have any hesitation in\npronouncing Attic oratory to be by far the best. But\nalthough all Attic writers have something in comion, namely a keen and exact judgement, their\ntalents manitest themselves in a number of different\nforms. Consequently I regard those critics as committing a serious error who regard only those\nauthors as Attic who, while they are simple, lucid\nand expressive, are none the less content with a\ncertain frugality of eloquence, and keep their hands\nmodestly within the folds of their cloaks. For what\nauthor is there who answers to this conception I\nam prepared to grant that there is Lysias, since he\nis the favourite model of the admirers of this school,\nand such an admission will save us from being\nreferred to Coccus and Andocides. But I should like\nto ask whether Isocrates spoke in the Attic style.\nFor there is no author less like Lysias. They will\nanswer in the negative. And yet it is to the school\nof Isocrates that we owe the greatest orators. Let\nus look for something closer. Is Hyperides\nAttic Yes, they reply, but of an over-sensuous\ncharacter. I pass by a number of orators, such as\nLyucrgus and Aristogeiton and their predecessors Isaeus and Antiphon; for though they have a certain\ngeneric resemblance, they may be said to differ in\nspecies. But what of Aesehines, whom I mentioned\njust now Is not his style ampler and holder and\nmore lofty than theirs And what of Demosthenes\nhimself Did not he surpass all those simple and\ncircumspect orators in force, loftiness, energy, polish\nand rhythm Does he not rise to great heights in\nhis commonplaces Does he not rejoice in the employment of figures Does he not make brilliant use of\nmetaphor Does he not lend a voice, a fictitious\nutterance to speechless things Does not his famous\noath by the warriors who fell fighting for their country\nat Salamis and Marathon show that Plato was his\nmaster And shall we call Plato an Asiatic, Plato\nwho as a rule deserves comparison with poets instinct\nwith the divine fire of inspiration What of Pericles\nCan we believe that his style was like the slender\nstream of Lysias' eloquence, when the comedians,\neven while they revile him, compare his oratory to\nthe bolts and thunder of the skies What is the\nreason, then, why these critics regard that style\nwhich flows in a slender trickle and babbles among\nthe pebbles as having the true Attic flavour and\nthe true scent of Attic thyme I really think that,\nif they were to discover a soil of exceptional richness\nand a crop of unusual abundance within the boundaries\nof Attica, they would deny it to be Attic, on the\nground that it has produced more seed than it\nreceived for you will remember the mocking comments passed by Menander on the exact fidelity\nwith which the soil of Attica repays its deposits.\nWell, then, if any man should, in addition to the\nactual virtues which the great orator Demosthenes possessed, show himself to be the possessor of others,\nthat either owing to his own temperament or the\nlaws of Athens Demosthenes is thought to have\nlacked, and should reveal in himself the power of\nstrongly stirring the emotions, shall I hear one of\nthese critics protesting that Demosthenes never did\nthis And if he produces something rhythmically\nsuperior an impossible feat, perhaps, but let us\nassume it to be so, are we to be told that it is not\nAttic These critics would show finer feeling and\nbetter judgement, if they took the view that Attic\neloquence meant perfect eloquence. Still I should find this attitude less intolerable if\nit were only the Greeks that insisted on it. For Latin\neloquence, although in my opinion it closely resembles\nthe Greek as far as invention, arrangement, judgement and the like are concerned, and may indeed be\nregarded as its disciple, cannot aspire to imitate it\nin point of elocution. For, in the first place, it is\nharsher in sound, since our alphabet does not contain\nthe most euphonious of the Greek letters, one a\nvowel and the other a consonant, than which there\nare none that fall more sweetly on the ear, and\nwhich we are forced to borrow whenever we use\nGreek words. The result of such borrowing is, for\nsome reason or other, the immediate accession to\nour language of a certain liveliness and charm.\nTake, for example, words such as sephyri and zophori\nif they were spelt according to the Latin alphabet,\nthey would produce a heavy and barbarous sound.\nFor we replace these letters by others of a harsh\nand unpleasant character, from which Greece is\nhappily immune. For the sixth letter in our alphabet\nis represented by a sound which can scarcely be called human or even articulate, being produced by\nforcing the air through the interstices of the teeth.\nSuch a sound, even when followed by a vowel, is\nharsh enough and, as often as it clashes frangit\nwith a consonant, as it does in this very word\nfrangit, becomes harsher still. Then there is the\nAeolic digamma whose sound occurs in words such\nas our servus and cervus; for even though we have\nrejected the actual form of the letter, we cannot\nget rid of that which it represents. Similarly the\nletter Q, which is superfluous and useless save for\nthe purpose of attaching to itself the vowels by\nwhich it is followed, results in the formation of\nharsh syllables, as, for example, when we write equos\nand aequum, more especially since these two vowels\ntogether produce a sound for which Greek has no\nequivalent and which cannot therefore be expressed\nin Greek letters. Again, we have a number of\nwords which end with M, a letter which suggests\nthe mooing of a cow, and is never the final letter\nin any Greek word for in its place they use the\nletters nu, the sound of which is naturally pleasant\nand produces a ringing tone when it occurs at the\nend of' a word, whereas in Latin this termination is\nscarcely ever found. Again, we have syllables which\nproduce such a harsh effect by ending in B and\nD, that many, not, it is true, of our most ancient\nwriters, but still writers of considerable antiquity,\nhave attempted to mitigate the harshness not merely\nby saying aversa for abversa, but by adding an S\nto the preposition ab, although S is an ugly letter\nin itself Our accents also are less agreeable than\nthose of the Greeks. This is due to a certain rigidity\nand monotony of pronunciation, since the final syllable is never marked by the rise of the acute\naccent nor by the rise and fill of the circumflex, but\none or even two grave accents are regularly to be\nfound at the end. Consequently the Greek language\nis so much more agreeable in sound than the Latin,\nthat our poets, whenever they wish their verse to\nbe especially harmonious, adorn it with Greek words.\nA still stronger indication of the inferiority of Latin\nis to be found in the fact that there are many things\nwhich have no Latin names, so that it is necessary\nto express them by metaphor or periphrasis, while\neven in the case of things which have names, the\nextreme poverty of the language leads us to resort\nto the same practice. On the other hand, the\nGreeks have not merely abundance of words, but\nthey have also a number of different dialects. Consequently he who demands from Latin the\ngrace of Attic Greek, must first provide a like\ncharm of tone and equal richness of vocabulary. If\nthis advantage is denied us, we must adapt our\nthoughts to suit the words we have and, where our\nmatter is unusually slight and delicate, must avoid\nexpressing it in words which are, I will not say too\ngross, but at any rate too strong for it, for fear that\nthe combination should result in the destruction\nboth of delicacy and force. For the less help we\nget from the language, the more must we rely on\ninventiveness of thought to bring us through the\nconflict. We must discover sentiments full of loftiness and variety, must stir all the emotions and\nillumine our style by brilliance of metaphor. Since\nwe cannot be so delicate, let us be stronger. If\nthey beat us for subtlety, let us prevail by weight,\nand if they have greater precision, let us outdo them in fullness of expression. Even the lesser\norators of Greece have their own havens where they\nmay ride in safety, while we as a rule carry more\nsail. Let stronger gales fill our canvas, and yet let\nus not always keep the high seas; for at times we\nmust cling to shore. The Greeks can easily traverse\nany shallows; I must find a deeper, though not\nmuch deeper, channel, that my bark may not run\naground. For even though the Greeks surpass us\nwhere circumstances call for delicacy and restraint,\nthough we acknowledge their superiority in this\nrespect alone, and therefore do not claim to rival\nthem in comedy, that is no justification for our\nabandonment of this department of oratory, but\nrather a reason why we should handle it as best we\ncan. Now we can at any rate resemble the Greeks\nin the method and judgement with which we treat\nour matter, although that grace of language, which\nour words cannot provide, must be secured by the\nadmixture of foreign condiments. For example, is\nnot Cicero shrewd, simple and not unduly exalted\nin tone, when he deals with private eases Is not\nCalidius also distinguished for the same virtue\nWere not Scipio, Laelius and Cato the Attic orators\nof Rome Surely we ought to be satisfied with\nthem, since nothing can be better. There are still some critics who deny that any\nform of eloquence is purely natural, except that\nwhich closely resembles the ordinary speech of everyday life, which we use to our friends, our wives, our\nchildren and our slaves, a language, that is to say,\nwhich contents itself with expressing the purpose\nof the mind without seeking to discover anything\nin the way of elaborate and far-fetched phraseology. And they hold that whatever is added to this\nsimplicity lays the speaker open to the charge of\naffectation and pretentious ostentation of speech,\nvoid of all sincerity and elaborated merely for the\nsake of the words, although the sole duty assigned\nto words by nature is to be the servants of thought.\nSuch language may be compared to the bodies of\nathletes, which although they develop their strength\nby exercise and diet, are of unnatural growth and\nabnormal in appearance. For what, say these critics,\nis the good of expressing a thing by periphrasis or\nmetaphor that is, either by a number of words or\nby words which have no connexion with the thing,\nwhen everything has been allotted a name of its\nown Finally, they urge that all the earliest orators\nspoke according to the dictates of nature, but that\nsubsequently there arose a class of speakers resembling poets rather than orators, who regarded\nfalse and artificial methods of expression as positive\nmerits; they were, it is true, more sparing than\nthe poets in their use of such expressions, but none\nthe less worked on similar lines. There is some\ntruth in this contention, and we should therefore\nbe careful not to depart from the more exact usage\nof ordinary speech to the extent that is done by\ncertain orators. On the other hand, that is no\nreason for thus calumniating the man who, as I said\nin dealing with the subject of artistic structure,\nsucceeds in improving upon the bare necessaries of\nstyle. For the common language of every day seems\nto me to be of a different character from the style\nof an eloquent speaker. If all that was required of\nthe latter was merely to indicate the facts, he might\nrest content with literalness of language, without further elaboration. But since it is his duty to\ndelight and move his audience and to play upon\nthe various feelings, it becomes necessary for him\nto employ those additional aids which are granted\nto us by that same nature which gave us speech.\nIt is, in fact, as natural to do this as to harden the\nmuscles, increase our strength and improve our complexion by means of exercise. It is for this reason\nthat among all nations one man is regarded as more\neloquent and more attractive in his style than\nanother since if this were not the case, all speakers\nwould be equal; but the same men speak differently on different subjects and observe distinctions\nof character. Consequently the more effective a\nman's speaking, the more in accordance with the\nnature of eloquence will it be. I have, therefore, no strong objection even to the\nviews expressed by those who think that some concession should be made to the circumstances under which\nwe speak and to the ears of the audience which\nrequire something more polished and emotional than\nordinary speech. For this reason I consider that it\nwould be absurd to restrict an orator to the style of\nthe predecessors of Cato and the Gracchi, or even\nof those orators themselves. And I note that it was\nthe practice of Cicero, while devoting himself in the\nmain to the interests of his case, to take into account\nthe delectation of his audience as well, since, as he\npointed out, his own interests were concerned as\nwell as those of his client, although of course the\nlatter were of paramount importance. For his very\ncharm was a valuable asset. I do not know what\ncan be added by way of improvement to the charms\nof his style, except perhaps the introduction of something more in the way of brilliant reflexions to\nsuit the taste of our own times. For this can be done\nwithout injury to the treatment of our case or inpairing the authority of our language, provided that\nsuch embellishments are not too frequent or continuous, and do not mutually destroy the effects\nwhich they were designed to produce. I am ready\nto go so far along the path of concession, but let no\nman press me further. I concur in the fashion of\nthe day to the extent of agreeing that the toga\nshould not be long in the nap, but not to the extent\nof insisting that it should be of silk I agree that\nthe hair should be cut, but not that it should be\ndressed in tiers and ringlets, since we must always\nremember that ornaments, unless they be judged\nfrom the standpoint of the fop and the debauchee,\nare always effective in proportion to their seemliness.\nBut with regard to those passages to which we give\nthe name of reflexions, a form of ornament which\nwas not employed by the ancients and, above all,\nnot by the Greeks, although I do find it in Cicero,\nwho can deny their usefulness, provided they are\nrelevant to the case, are not too diffuse and contribute to our success For they strike the mind\nand often produce a decisive effect by one single\nblow, while their very brevity makes them cling to\nthe memory, and the pleasure which they produce\nhas the force of persuasion. There are, however, some who, while allowing\nthe actual delivery of such specially brilliant forms\nof ornament, think that they should be excluded\nfrom the written speech. Consequently I must not\ndismiss even this topic without a word of discussion. For a number of learned authorities have held that the written and the spoken speech\nstand on different footings, and that consequently\nsome of the most eloquent of speakers have left\nnothing for posterity to read in durable literary form,\nas, for example, is the case with Pericles and Decades\nAgain, they urge that there have been authors, like\nIsocrates, who, while admirable writers, were not\nwell-fitted for actual speaking; and, further, that\nactual pleading is characterised by a greater energy\nand by the employment, almost verging on license,\nof every artifice designed to please, since the minds\nof an uneducated audience require to be moved and\nled. On the other hand, the written speech with\nis published as a model of style must be polished\nand filed and brought into conformity with the\naccepted rules and standards of artistic construction,\nsince it will come into the hands of learned men\nand its art will be judged by artists. These subtle\nteachers for such they have persuaded themselves\nand others that they are have laid it down that\nthe is best suited for actual speech and\nthe for writing. My own view is that\nthere is absolutely no difference between writing\nwell and speaking well, and that a written speech\nis merely a record of one that has actually been\ndelivered. Consequently it must in my opinion\npossess every kind of merit, and note that I say\nmerit, not fault. For I know that faults do sometimes meet with the approval of the uneducated.\nWhat, then, will be the difference between what is\nwritten and what is spoken If I were given a jury\nof wise men, I should cut down a large number of\npassages from the speeches not only of Cicero, but\neven of Demosthenes, who is much more concise. For with such a jury there would be no need to\nappeal to the emotions nor to charm and soothe the\nears, since according to Aristotle even exordia are\nsuperfluous, if addressed to such persons, as they\nwill have no influence upon judges who are truly\nwise it will be sufficient to state the facts with\nprecision and significance and to marshal our array\nof proofs. Since, however, our judges are the\npeople, or drawn from the people, and since those\nwho are appointed to give sentence are frequently\nill-educated and sometimes mere rustics, it becomes\nnecessary to employ every method that we think\nlikely to assist our case, and these artifices must\nnot merely be produced in speech, but exhibited in\nthe written version as well, at least if in writing it\nour design is to show how it should be spoken. If\nDemosthenes or Cicero had spoken the words as\nthey wrote them, would either have spoken ill\nAnd is our acquaintance with either of those two\ngreat orators based on anything save their writings\nDid they speak better, then, or worse than they\nwrote If they spoke worse, all that can be said\nis that they should have spoken as they wrote,\nwhile, if they spoke better, they should have\nwritten as they spoke. Well, you ask, is an orator\nthen always to speak as he writes If possible,\nalways. If, however, the time allowed by the\njudge is too short for this to be possible, he will\nhave to cut out much that he should have said,\nbut the published speech will contain the omitted\npassages. On the other hand, such passages as\nwere uttered merely to suit the character of the\njudges will not be published for the benefit of\nposterity, for fear that they should seem to indicate the author's deliberate judgement instead of being\na mere concession to the needs of the moment.\nFor it is most important that we should know how\nthe judge is disposed to listen, and his face will\noften as Cicero reminds us serve as a guide to\nthe speaker. Consequently we must press the points\nthat we see commend themselves to him, and draw\nback from those which are ill-received, while our\nactual language must be so modified that he will\nfind our arguments as intelligible as possible. That\nthis should be necessary is scarcely surprising, when\nwe consider the alterations that are frequently\nnecessary to suit the characters of the different\nwitnesses. He was a shrewd man who, when he\nasked a rustic witness whether he knew Amphion,\nand the witness replied that he did not, dropped\nthe aspirate and shortened the second syllable,\nwhereupon the witness recognised him at once.\nSuch situations, when it is impossible to speak as\nwe write, will sometimes make it necessary to speak\nin language other than that which we use in\nwriting. There is another threefold division, whereby,\nit is held, we may differentiate three styles of\nspeaking, all of them correct. The first is termed\nthe plain or , the second grand and\nforcible or , and the third either intermediate or florid, the latter being a translation\nof The nature of these three styles is,\nbroadly speaking, as follows. The first would seem\nbest adapted for instructing, the second for moving,\nand the third by whichever name we call it for\ncharming or, as others would have it, conciliating\nthe audience; for instruction the quality most needed is acumen, for conciliation gentleness, and\nfor stirring the emotions force. Consequently it is\nmainly in the plain style that we shall state our\nfacts and advance our proofs, though it should be\nborne in mind that this style will often be sufficiently\nfull in itself without any assistance whatever from\nthe other two. The intermediate style will have\nmore frequent recourse to metaphor and will make\na more attractive use of figures, while it will introduce alluring digressions, will be neat in rhythm\nand pleasing in its reflexions its flow, however, will\nbe gentle, like that of a river whose waters are clear,\nbut overshadowed by the green banks on either side.\nBut he whose eloquence is like to some great torrent\nthat rolls down rocks and and\ncarves out its own banks for itself, will sweep the\njudge from his feet, struggle as he may, and force\nhim to go whither he bears him. This is the orator\nthat will call the dead to life as, for example, Cicero\ncalls upon Appius Caecus; it is in his pages\nthat his native land itself will cry aloud and at\ntimes address the orator himself, as it addresses\nCicero in the speech delivered against Catiline in\nthe senate. Such an orator will also exalt his style\nby amplification and rise even to hyperbole, as when\nCicero cries, or etc. I choose these fine passages as being\nfamiliar to the student. It is such an one that\nwill bring down the Gods to form part of his\naudience or even to speak with him, as in the\nfollowing, This is he that will\ninspire anger or pity, and while he speaks the judge\nwill call upon the gods and weep, following him\nwherever he sweeps him from one emotion to\nanother, and no longer asking merely for instruction.\nWherefore if one of these three styles has to be\nselected to the exclusion of the others, who will\nhesitate to prefer this style to all others, since it\nis by far the strongest and the best adapted to the\nmost important cases For Homer himself assigns\nto Menelaus an eloquence, terse and pleasing, exact\nfor that is what is meant by  and devoid of all redundance, which qualities\nare virtues of the first type and he says that from\nthe lips of Nestor flowed speech sweeter than honey,\nthan which assuredly we can conceive no greater\ndelight but when he seeks to express the supreme\ngift of eloquence possessed by Ulysses he gives a\nmighty voice and a vehemence of oratory equal to\nthe snows of winter in the abundance and the vigour\nof its words. he says, It is this force and impetuosity that Eupolis\nadmires in Pericles, this that Aristophanes compares\nto the thunderbolt, this that is the power of true\neloquence. But eloquence cannot be confined even to these\nthree forms of style. For just as the third style is\nintermediate between the grand and the plain style,\nso each of these three are separated by interspaces which are occupied by intermediate styles compounded of the two which he on either side. For\nthere are styles fuller or plainer than the plain, and\ngentler or more vehement than the vehement, while\nthe gentler style itself may either rise to greater\nforce or sink to milder tones. Thus we may discover\nalmost countless species of styles, each differing from\nthe other by some fine shade of difference. We may\ndraw a parallel from the winds. It is generally accepted that there are four blowing from the four\nquarters of the globe, but we find there are also\na large number of winds which he between these,\ncalled by a variety of names, and in certain cases\nconfined to certain districts and river valleys. The\nsame thing may be noted in music. For after assigning five notes to the lyre, musicians fill up the\nintervals between the strings by a variety of notes,\nand between these again they interpose yet others,\nso that the original divisions admit of a number of\ngradations. Eloquence has, therefore, a quantity of different\naspects, but it is sheer folly to inquire which of these\nthe orator should take as his model, since every\nspecies that is in itself correct has its use, and what\nis commonly called style of speaking does not depend\non the orator. For he will use all styles, as circumstances may demand, and the choice will be\ndetermined not only by the case as a whole, but by\nthe demands of the different portions of the case.\nFor just as he will not speak in the same way when\nhe is defending a client on a capital charge and\nwhen he is speaking in a lawsuit concerned with an\ninheritance, or discussing interdicts and suits taking\nthe form of a wager, or claims in connexion with loans, so too he will preserve a due distinction\nbetween the speeches which he makes in the senate,\nbefore the people and in private consultations, while\nhe will also introduce numerous modifications to\nsuit the different persons and circumstances of time\nand place. Thus in one and the same speech he\nwill use one style for stirring the emotions, and\nanother to conciliate his hearers; it is from different\nsources that he will derive anger or pity, and the\nart which he employs in instructing the judge will\nbe other than that which he employs to move him.\nHe will not maintain the same tone throughout his\nexordium, statement of fact, arguments, digression and\nperoration. He will speak gravely, severely, sharply,\nwith vehemence, energy, fullness, bitterness, or\ngeniality, quietly, simply, Hatteringly, gently, sweetly,\nbriefy or wittily; he will not always be like himself, but he will never be unworthy of himself.\nThus the purpose for which oratory was above all\ndesigned will be secured, that is to say, he will\nspeak with profit and with power to effect his aim,\nwhile he will also win the praise not merely of the\nlearned, but of the multitude as well. They make the gravest mistake who consider that\nthe style which is best adapted to win popularity\nand applause is a faulty and corrupt style of speaking\nwhich revels in license of diction or wantons in\nchildish epigram or swells with stilted bombast or\nriots in empty commonplace or adorns itself with\nblossoms of eloquence which will fall to earth if\nbut lightly shaken, or regards extravagance as\nsublime or raves wildly under the pretext of free\nspeech. I am ready to admit that such qualities\nplease many, and I feel no surprise that this should be the case. For any kind of eloquence is pleasing\nand attractive to the car, and every effort of the\nvoice inspires a natural pleasure in the soul of man;\nindeed this is the sole cause of those familiar gatherings in the Forum or on the Old Wall, so that there\nis small reason for wonder if any pleader is safe to\ndraw a ring of listeners from the crowd. And when\nany unusually precious phrase strikes the ears of an\nuneducated audience, whatever its true merits, it\nwakens their admiration just for the very reason\nthat they feel they could never have produced it\nthemselves. And it deserves their admiration, since\neven such success is hard to attain. On the other\nhand, when such displays are compared with their\nbetters, they sink into insignificance and fade out\nof sight, for they are like wool dyed red that\npleases in the absence of purple, but, as Ovid says,\nif compared with a cloak of Tyrian dye, pales in the\npresence of the fairer hue. If, however, we test\nsuch corrupt eloquence by the touchstone of a critical\ntaste, as, for example, we test inferior dyes with\nsulphur, it will lay aside the false brilliance that\ndeceived the eye and fade to a pallor almost too\nrepulsive to describe. Such passages shine only in\nthe absence of the sunlight, just as certain tiny\ninsects seem transformed in the darkness to little\nflames of fire. Finally, while many approve of things\nthat are bad, no one disapproves of that which is\ngood. But the true orator will not merely be able to\nachieve all the feats of which I have spoken with\nsupreme excellence, but with the utmost ease as\nwell. For the sovereign power of eloquence and\nthe voice that awakens well-deserved applause will be free from the perpetual distress of harassing\nanxiety which wastes and fevers the orator who\npainfully corrects himself and pines away over the\nlaborious weighing and piecing together of his\nwords. No, our orator, brilliant, sublime and\nopulent of speech, is lord and master of all the\nresources of eloquence, whose affluence surrounds\nhim. For he that has reached the summit has no\nmore weary hills to scale. At first the climber's toil\nis hard, but the higher he mounts the easier becomes the gradient and the richer the soil. And\nif by perseverance of study he pass even beyond\nthese gentler slopes, fruits for which none have\ntoiled thrust themselves upon him, and all things\nspring forth unbidden; and yet if they be not\ngathered daily, they will wither away. But even\nsuch wealth must observe the mean, without which\nnothing is either praiseworthy or beneficial, while\nbrilliance must be attended by manliness, and imagination by soundness of taste. Thus the works\nof the orator will be great not extravagant, sublime\nnot bombastic, bold not rash, severe but not gloomy,\ngrave but not slow, rich but not luxuriant, pleasing\nbut not effeminate, grand but not grandiose. It is\nthe same with other qualities the mean is safest,\nfor the worst of all faults is to fly to extremes. After employing these gifts of eloquence in\nthe courts, in councils, in public assemblies and the\ndebates of the senate, and, in a word, in the performance of all the duties of a good citizen, the\norator will bring his activities to a close in a manner\nworthy of a blameless life spent in the pursuit of\nthe noblest of professions. And he will do this,\nnot because he can ever have enough of doing good, or because one endowed with intellect and talents\nsuch as his would not be justified in praying that\nsuch glorious labours may be prolonged to their\nutmost span, but for this reason, that it is his duty\nto look to the future, for fear that his work may be\nless effective than it has been in the past. For the\norator depends not merely on his knowledge, which\nincreases with the years, but on his voice, lungs and\npowers of endurance. And if these be broken or\nimpaired by age or health, he must beware that he\ndoes not fall short in something of his high reputation as a master of oratory, that fatigue does not\ninterrupt his eloquence, that he is not brought to\nrealise that some of his words are inaudible, or to\nmourn that he is not what once he was. Domitius\nAfer was by far the greatest of all the orators whom\nit has been my good fortune to know, and I saw\nhim, when far advanced in years, daily losing something of that authority which his merits had won\nfor him; he whose supremacy in the courts had once\nbeen universally acknowledged, now pleaded amid\nthe unworthy laughter of some, and the silent\nblushes of others, giving occasion to the malicious\nsaying that he had rather And\nyet even then, whatever his deficiencies, he spoke\nnot badly, but merely less well. Therefore before ever he fall a prey to the ambush\nwhere time lies in wait for him, the orator should\nsound the retreat and seek harbour while his ship\nis yet intact. For the fruits of his studies will\nnot be lessened by retirement. Either he will bequeath the history of his own times for the delight\nof after ages, or will interpret the law to those\nwho seek his counsels, as Lucius Crassus proposes to do in the de Oratore of Cicero, or compose some\ntreatise on the art of oratory, or give worthy utterance\nto the sublimest ideals of conduct. His house\nwill, as in the days of old, be thronged by all\nthe best of the rising generation, who will seek to\nlearn from him as from an oracle how they may find\nthe path to true eloquence. And he as their father\nin the art will mould them to all excellence, and\nlike some old pilot will teach them of the shores\nwhereby their ships must sail, of the harbours where\nthey may shelter, and the signs of the weather, and\nwill expound to them what they shall do when the\nbreeze is fair or the tempest blows. Whereto he\nwill be inclined not only by the common duty of\nhumanity, but by a certain passion for the task that\nonce was his, since no man desires that the art\nwherein he was once supreme should suffer decay\nor diminution. And what can be more honourable\nthan to teach that which you know surpassing well\nIt was for this that the elder Caelius brought his son\nto Cicero, as the latter tells us, and it was with this\nintent that the same great orator took upon himself\nthe duties of instructor, and trained Pansa, Hirtius\nand Dolabella by declaiming daily before them or\nhearing them declaim. And I know not whether\nwe should not deem it the happiest moment in an\norator's life, when he has retired from the public\ngaze, the consecrated priest of eloquence, free from\nenvy and far from strife, when he has set his glory\non a pinnacle beyond the reach of detraction, enjoys,\nwhile still living, that veneration which most men\nwin but after death, and sees how great shall be his\nrenown amid generations yet unborn. I can say with a good conscience that, as far as my poor powers have permitted, I have published\nfrankly and disinterestedly, for the benefit of such\nas might wish to learn, all that my previous knowledge and the researches made for the purpose of\nthis work might supply. And to have taught what\nlie knows is satisfaction enough for any good man.\nI fear, however, that I may be regarded as setting\ntoo lofty an ideal for the orator by insisting that he\nshould be a good man skilled in speaking, or as\nimposing too many subjects of study on the learner.\nFor in addition to the many branches of knowledge\nwhich have to be studied in boyhood and the traditional rules of eloquence, I have enjoined the study\nof morals and of civil law, so that I am afraid that\neven those who have regarded these things as\nessential to my theme, may he appalled at the delay\nwhich they impose and abandon all hope of achievement before they have put my precepts to the test.\nI would ask them to consider how great are the\npowers of the mind of man and how astonishing its\ncapacity for carrying its desires into execution for\nhas not man succeeded in crossing the high seas, in\nlearning the number and the courses of the stars,\nand almost measuring the universe itself, all of them\naccomplishments of less importance than oratory, but\nof far greater difficulty And then let them reflect\non the greatness of' their aims and on the fact that\nno labour should be too huge for those that are\nbeckoned by the hope of such reward. If they can\nonly rise to the height of this conception, they will\nfind it easier to enter on this portion of their task,\nand will cease to regard the road as impassable or\neven hard. For the first and greatest of' the aims\nwe set before us, namely that we shall be good men, depends for its achievement mainly on the\nwill to succeed and he that truly and sincerely\nforms such resolve, will easily acquire those forms\nof knowledge that teach the way to virtue. For\nthe precepts that are enjoined upon us are not\nso complex or so numerous that they may be\nacquired by little more than a few years' study. It\nis repugnance to learn that makes such labour long.\nFor if you will only believe it, you will quickly learn\nthe principles that shall lead you to a life of virtue\nand happiness. For nature brought us into the world\nthat we might attain to all excellence of mind, and\nso easy is it for those to learn who seek for better\nthings, that he who directs his gaze aright will\nrather marvel that the bad should be so many. For\nas water is the natural element of fish, dry land\nfor creatures of the earth and the circumambient\natmosphere for winged things, even so it should\nbe easier to live according to nature than counter\nto her will. As regards other accomplishments,\nthere are plenty of years available for their acquisition, even though we measure the life of man not\nby the span of age, but by the period of youth. For\nin every case order and method and a sense of proportion will shorten our labour. But the chief fault\nlies with our teachers, in that they love to keep back\nthe pupils they have managed to lay their hands on,\npartly from the desire to draw their miserable fees\nfor as long as possible, partly out of ostentation, to\nenhance the difficulty of acquiring the knowledge\nwhich they promise to impart, and to some extent\nowing to their ignorance or carelessness in teaching.\nThe next most serious fault lies in ourselves, who\nthink it better to linger over what we have learned than to learn what we do not yet know. For example, to restrict my remarks mainly to the study\nof rhetoric, what is the use of spending so many\nyears, after the fashion now so prevalent for I will\nsay nothing of those who spend almost their whole\nlives, in declaiming in the schools and devoting so\nmuch labour to the treatment of fictitious themes,\nwhen it would be possible with but slight expenditure\nof time to form some idea of what the true conflicts\nare in which the orator must engage, and of the\nlaws of speaking which he ought to follow In\nsaying this, I do not for a moment mean to suggest\nthat we should ever omit to exercise ourselves in\nspeaking. I merely urge that we should not grow old\nover one special form of exercise. We have been in a\nposition to acquire varied knowledge, to familiarise\nourselves with the principles that should guide our\nlife, and to try our strength in the courts, while we\nwere still attending the schools. The theory of speaking is of such a nature that it does not demand\nmany years for its acquisition. For any one of the\nvarious branches of knowledge which I have mentioned will, as a rule, be found to be comprised in\na few volumes, a fact which shows that instruction\ndoes not require an indefinite amount of time to be\ndevoted to it. The rest depends entirely on practice,\nwhich at once develops our powers and maintains\nthem, once developed. Knowledge increases day\nby day, and yet how many books is it absolutely\nnecessary to read in our search for its attainment, for\nexamples of facts from the historians or of eloquence\nfrom the orators, or, again, for the opinions of the\nphilosophers and the lawyers, that is to say, if we\nare content to read merely what is useful without attempting the impossible task of reading everything But it is ourselves that make the time for\nstudy short for how little time we allot to it\nSome hours are passed in the futile labour of ceremonial calls, others in idle chatter, others in staring\nat the shows of the theatre, and others again in\nfeasting. To this add all the various forms of amusement, the insane attention devoted to the cultivation\nof the body, journeys abroad, visits to the country,\nanxious calculation of loss and gain, the allurements\nof lust, wine-bibbing and those remaining hours\nwhich are all too few to gratify our souls on fire\nwith passion for every kind of pleasure. If all this\ntime were spent on study, life would seem long\nenough and there would be plenty of time for learning, even though we should take the hours of daylight only into our account, without asking any\nassistance from the night, of which no little space\nis superfluous even for the heaviest sleeper. As it\nis, we count not the years which we have given to\nstudy, but the years we have lived. And indeed\neven although geometricians, musicians and grammarians, together with the professors of every other\nbranch of knowledge, spend all their lives, however\nlong, in the study of one single science, it does not\ntherefore follow that we require several lives more\nif we are to learn more. For they do not spend all\ntheir days even to old age in learning these things,\nbut being content to have learned these things and\nnothing more, exhaust their length of years not in\nacquiring, but in imparting knowledge. However, to say nothing of Homer, in whom we\nmay find either the perfect achievements, or at\nany rate clear signs of the knowledge of every art, and to pass by Hippias of Elis, who not merely\nboasted his knowledge of the liberal arts, but wore\na robe, a ring and shoes, all of which he had made\nwith his own hands, and had trained himself to be\nindependent of external assistance, we accept the\nuniversal tradition of Greece to the effect that\nGorgias, triumphant over all the countless ills incident to extreme old age, would bid his hearers\npropound any questions they pleased for him to\nanswer. Again in what branch of knowledge\nworthy of literary expression was Plato deficient\nHow many generations' study did Aristotle require to embrace not merely the whole range of\nphilosophical and rhetorical knowledge, but to\ninvestigate the nature of every beast and plant.\nAnd yet they had to discover all these things which\nwe only have to learn. Antiquity has given us all\nthese teachers and all these patterns for our imitation,\nthat there might be no greater happiness conceivable\nthan to be born in this age above all others, since\nall previous ages have toiled that we might reap the\nfruit of their wisdom. Marcus Cato was at once a\ngreat general, a philosopher, orator, historian, and\nan expert both in law and agriculture, and despite\nhis military labours abroad and the distractions of\npolitical struggles at home, and despite the rudeness\nof the age in which he lived, he none the less\nlearned Greek, when far advanced in years, that he\nmight prove to mankind that even old men are\ncapable of learning that on which they have set\ntheir hearts. How wide, almost universal, was the\nknowledge that Varro communicated to the world\nWhat of all that goes to make up the equipment of\nan orator was lacking to Cicero Why should I say more, since even Cornelius Celsus, a man of very\nordinary ability, not merely wrote about rhetoric in\nall its departments, but left treatises on the art of\nwar, agriculture and medicine as well. Indeed the\nhigh ambition revealed by his design gives him the\nright to ask us to believe that he was acquainted\nwith all these subjects. But, it will be urged, to carry out such a task is\ndifficult and has never been accomplished. To\nwhich I reply that sufficient encouragement for\nstudy may be found in the fact, firstly, that nature\ndoes not forbid such achievement and it does not\nfollow that, because a thing never has been done, it\ntherefore never can be done, and secondly, that all\ngreat achievements have required time for their first\naccomplishment. Poetry has risen to the heights\nof glory, thanks to the efforts of poets so far apart\nas Homer and Virgil, and oratory owes its position\nto the genius of Demosthenes and Cicero. Finally,\nwhatever is best in its own sphere must at some\nprevious time have been non-existent. But even if\na man despair of reaching supreme excellence and\nwhy should he despair, if he have talents, health,\ncapacity and teachers to aid him, it is none the\nless a fine achievement, as Cicero says, to win the\nrank of second or even third. For even if a soldier\ncannot achieve the glory of Achilles in war, he will\nnot despise fame such as fell to the lot of Ajax and\nDiomede, while those who cannot be Homers may\nbe content to reach the level of Tyrtaeus. Nay, if\nmen had been obsessed by the conviction that it was\nimpossible to surpass the man who had so far shown\nhimself best, those whom we now regard as best\nwould never have reached such distinction, Lucretius and Macer would never have been succeeded by\nVirgil, nor Crassus and Hortensius by Cicero, nor\nthey in their turn by those who flourished after\nthem. But even though we cannot hope to surpass\nthe great, it is still a high honour to follow in their\nfootsteps. Did Pollio and Messala, who began to\nplead when Cicero held the citadel of eloquence,\nfail to obtain sufficient honour in their lifetime or\nto hand down a fair name to posterity The arts\nwhich have been developed to the highest pitch\nof excellence would deserve but ill of mankind if\nthat which was best had also been the last of its\nline. Add to this the further consideration that\neven moderate eloquence is often productive of\ngreat results and, if such studies are to be measured\nsolely by their utility, is almost equal to the perfect\neloquence for which we seek. Nor would it be difficult\nto produce either ancient or recent examples to show\nthat there is no other source from which men have\nreaped such a harvest of wealth, honour, friendship\nand glory, both present and to come. But it would\nbe a disgrace to learning to follow the fashion of those\nwho say that they pursue not virtue, but only the\npleasure derived from virtue, and to demand this\nmeaner recompense from the noblest of all arts, whose\npractice and even whose possession is ample reward\nfor all our labours. Wherefore let us seek with all\nour hearts that true majesty of oratory, the fairest\ngift of god to man, without which all things are\nstricken dumb and robbed alike of present glory and\nthe immortal record of posterity; and let us press\nforward to whatsoever is best, since, if we do this,\nwe shall either reach the summit or at least see\nmany others far beneath us. Such, Marcellus Victorius, were the views by\nthe expression of which it seemed to me that I\nmight, as far as in me lay, help to advance the\nteaching of oratory. If the knowledge of these\nprinciples proves to be of small practical utility to\nthe young student, it should at least produce what\nvalue more,the will to do well. The orator then, whom I am concerned to form,\nshall be the orator as defined by Marcus Cato, But above all he must\npossess the quality which Cato places first and which\nis in the very nature of things the greatest and most\nimportant, that is, he must be a good man. This is\nessential not merely on account of the fact that, if\nthe powers of eloquence serve only to lend arms to\ncrime, there can be nothing more pernicious than eloquence to public and private welfare alike, while\nI myself, who have laboured to the best of my ability\nto contribute something of value to oratory, shall have\nrendered the worst of services to mankind, if I forge\nthese weapons not for a soldier, but for a robber.\nBut why speak of myself Nature herself will have\nproved not a mother, but a stepmother with regard\nto what we deem her greatest gift to man, the gift\nthat distinguishes us from other living things, if she\ndevised the power of speech to be the accomplice of\ncrime, the foe to innocency and the enemy of truth.\nFor it had been better for men to be born dumb and\ndevoid of reason than to turn the gifts of providence\nto their mutual destruction. But this conviction of\nmine goes further. For I do not merely assert that\nthe ideal orator should be a good man, but I affirm\nthat no man can be an orator unless he is a good man.\nFor it is impossible to regard those men as gifted\nwith intelligence who on being offered the choice\nbetween the two paths of virtue and of vice choose\nthe latter, nor can we allow them prudence, when\nby the unforeseen issue of their own actions they\nrender themselves liable not merely to the heaviest\npenalties of the laws, but to the inevitable torment\nof an evil conscience. But if the view that a bad\nman is necessarily a fool is not merely held by philosolphers, but is the universal belief of ordinary men,\nthe fool will most assuredly never become an orator.\nTo this must be added the fact that the mind will\nnot find leisure even for the study of the noblest of\ntasks, unless it first be free from vice. The reasons for\nthis are, first, that vileness and virtue cannot jointly\ninhabit in the selfsame heart and that it is as impossible for one and the same mind to harbour good and evil thoughts as it is for one man to be at once\nboth good and evil and secondly, that if the intelligence is to be concentrated on such a vast subject as\neloquence it must be free from all other distractions,\namong which must be included even those preoccupations which are free from blame. For it is only\nwhen it is free and self-possessed, with nothing to\ndivert it or lure it elsewhere, that it will fix its\nattention solely on that goal, the attainment of which\nis the object of its preparations. If on the other\nhand inordinate care for the development of our\nestates, excess of anxiety over household affairs,\npassionate devotion to hunting or the sacrifice of\nwhole days to the shows of the theatre, rob our\nstudies of much of the time that is their due for\nevery moment that is given to other things involves\na loss of time for study, what, think you, will be the\nresults of desire, avarice, and envy, which waken such\nviolent thoughts within our souls that they disturb\nour very slumbers and our dreams There is nothing\nso preoccupied, so distracted, so rent and torn by so\nmany and such varied passions as an evil mind. For\nwhen it cherishes some dark design, it is tormented\nwith hope, care and anguish of spirit, and even when\nit has accomplished its criminal purpose, it is racked\nby anxiety, remorse and the fear of all manner of\npunishments. Amid such passions as these what\nroom is there for literature or any virtuous pursuit\nYou might as well look for fruit in land that is choked\nwith thorns and brambles. Well then, I ask you, is\nnot simplicity of life essential if we are to be able to\nendure the toil entailed by study What can we\nhope to get from lust or luxury Is not the desire\nto win praise one of the strongest stimulants to a passion for literature But does that mean that we\nare to suppose that praise is an object of concern to\nbad men Surely every one of my readers must by\nnow have realised that oratory is in the main concerned with the treatment of what is just and\nhonourable Can a bad and unjust man speak on\nsuch themes as the dignity of the subject demands\nNay, even if we exclude the most important aspects\nof the question now before us, and make the impossible concession that the best and worst of men\nmay have the same talent, industry and learning, we\nare still confronted by the question as to which of\nthe two is entitled to be called the better orator. The\nanswer is surely clear enough it will be he who is\nthe better man. Consequently, the bad man and the\nperfect orator can never be identical. For nothing\nis perfect, if there exists something else that is\nbetter. However, as I do not wish to appear to\nadopt the practice dear to the Socratics of framing\nanswers to my own questions, let me assume the\nexistence of a man so obstinately blind to the truth\nas to venture to maintain that a bad man equipped\nwith the same talents, industry and learning will\nbe not a whit inferior to the good man as an\norator; and let me show that he too is mad.\nThere is one point at any rate which no one will\nquestion, namely, that the aim of every speech is to\nconvince the judge that the case which it puts forward is true and honourable. Well then, which will\ndo this best, the good man or the bad The good\nman will without doubt more often say what is true\nand honourable. But even supposing that his duty\nshould, as I shall show may sometimes happen, lead\nhim to make statements which are false, his words are still certain to carry greater weight with his\naudience. On the other hand bad men, in their\ncontempt for public opinion and their ignorance of\nwhat is right, sometimes drop their mask unawares,\nand are impudent in the statement of their case and\nshameless in their assertions. Further, in their\nattempt to achieve the impossible they display an\nunseemly persistency and unavailing energy. For\nin lawsuits no less than in the ordinary paths of\nlife, they cherish depraved expectations. But it\noften happens that even when they tell the truth\nthey fail to win belief, and the mere fact that such\na man is its advocate is regarded as an indication of\nthe badness of the case. I must now proceed to deal with the objections\nwhich common opinion is practically unanimous in\nbringing against this view. Was not Demosthenes\nan orator And yet we are told that he was a bad\nman. Was not Cicero an orator And yet there\nare many who have found fault with his character as\nwell. What am I to answer My reply will be\nhighly unpopular and I must first attempt to conciliate my audience. I do not consider that\nDemosthenes deserves the serious reflexions that\nhave been made upon his character to such an\nextent that I am bound to believe all the charges\namassed against him by his enemies; for my reading\ntells me that his public policy was of the noblest and\nhis end most glorious. Again, I cannot see that the\naims of Cicero were in any portion of his career other\nthan such as may become an excellent citizen. As\nevidence I would cite the fact that his behaviour as\nconsul was magnificent and his administration of his\nprovince a model of integrity, while he refused to become one of the twenty commissioners, and in the\ngrievous civil wars which afflicted his generation\nbeyond all others, neither hope nor fear ever deterred\nhim from giving his support to the better party, that\nis to say, to the interests of the common weal.\nSome, it is true, regard him as lacking in courage.\nThe best answer to these critics is to be found in his\nown words, to the effect that he was timid not in\nconfronting peril, but in anticipating it. And this\nhe proved also by the manner of his death, in meeting\nwhich he displayed a singular fortitude. But even\nif these two men lacked the perfection of virtue, I\nwill reply to those who ask if they were orators, in\nthe manner in which the Stoics would reply, if asked\nwhether Zeno, Cleanthes or Chrysippus himself were\nwise men. I shall say that they were great men\ndeserving our veneration, but that they did not\nattain to that which is the highest perfection\nof man's nature. For did not Pythagoras desire\nthat he should not be called a wise man, like the\nsages who preceded him, but rather a student of\nwisdom But for my own part, conforming to the\nlanguage of every day, I have said time and again,\nand shall continue to say, that Cicero was a perfect\norator, just as in ordinary speech we call our friends\ngood and sensible men, although neither of these\ntitles can really be given to any save to him that\nhas attained to perfect wisdom. But if I am called\nupon to speak strictly and in accordance with the\nmost rigid laws of truth, I shall proclaim that I seek\nto find that same perfect orator whom Cicero also\nsought to discover. For while I admit that he stood\non the loftiest pinnacle of eloquence, and can discover scarcely a single deficiency in him, although I might perhaps discover certain superfluities which I\nthink he would have pruned away for the general\nview of the learned is that he possessed many virtues\nand a few faults, and he himself states that he has\nsucceeded in suppressing much of his youthful\nexuberance, none the less, in view of the fact that,\nalthough he had by no means a low opinion of himself, he never claimed to be the perfect sage, and,\nhad he been granted longer life and less troubled conditions for the composition of his works, would doubtless have spoken better still, I shall not lay myself\nopen to the charge of ungenerous criticism, if I say\nthat I believe that he failed actually to achieve that\nperfection to the attainment of which none have\napproached more nearly, and indeed had I felt otherwise in this connexion, I might have defended my\npoint with greater boldness and freedom. Marcus\nAntonius declared that he had seen no man who was\ngenuinely eloquent and to be eloquent is a far less\nachievement than to be an orator, while Cicero himself has failed to find his orator in actual life and\nmerely imagines and strives to depict the ideal. Shall\nI then be afraid to say that in the eternity of time\nthat is yet to be, something more perfect may be found\nthan has yet existed I say nothing of those critics\nwho will not allow sufficient credit even for eloquence\nto Cicero and Demosthenes, although Cicero himself\ndoes not regard Demosthenes as flawless, but asserts\nthat he sometimes nods, while even Cicero fails to\nsatisfy Brutus and Calvus at any rate they criticised\nhis style to his face, or to win the complete approval\nof either of the Asinii, who in various passages attack\nthe faults of his oratory in language which is positively\nhosthe. However, let us fly in the face of nature and\nassume that a bad man has been discovered who is\nendowed with the highest eloquence. I shall none\nthe less deny that he is an orator. For I should not\nallow that every man who has shown himself ready\nwith his hands was necessarily a brave man, because\ntrue courage cannot be conceived of without the\naccompaniment of virtue. Surely the advocate who\nis called to defend the accused requires to be a man\nof honour, honour which greed cannot corrupt, influence seduce, or fear dismay. Shall we then dignify the traitor, the deserter, the turncoat with the\nsacred name of orator But if the quality which is\nusually termed goodness is to be found even in quite\nordinary advocates, why should not the orator, who\nhas not yet existed, but may still be born, be no less\nperfect in character than in excellence of speech\nIt is no hack-advocate, no hireling pleader, nor yet,\nto use no harser term, a serviceable attorney of the\nclass generally known as causidici, that I am seeking to\nform, but rather a man who to extraordinary natural\ngifts has added a thorough mastery of all the fairest\nbranches of knowledge, a man sent by heaven to be\nthe blessing of mankind, one to whom all history\ncan find no parallel, uniquely perfect in every detail\nand utterly noble alike in thought and speech. How\nsmall a portion of all these abilities will be required\nfor the defence of the innocent, the repression of\ncrime or the support of truth against falsehood in\nsuits involving questions of money It is true that\nour supreme orator will bear his part in such tasks,\nbut his powers will be displayed with brighter splendour in greater matters than these, when he is\ncalled upon to direct the counsels of the senate and guide the people from the paths of error to better\nthings. Was not this the man conceived by Virgil\nand described as quelling a riot when torches and\nstones have begun to fly Here then we have one who is before all else a\ngood man, and it is only after this that the poet adds\nthat he is skilled in speaking Again, will not this same man, whom we are striving\nto form, if in time of war he be called upon to inspire\nhis soldiers with courage for the fray, draw for his\neloquence on the innermost precepts of philosophy\nFor how can men who stand upon the verge of battle\nbanish all the crowding fears of hardship, pain and\ndeath from their minds, unless those fears be replaced by the sense of the duty that they owe\ntheir country, by courage and the lively image of a\nsoldier's honour And assuredly the man who will\nbest inspire such feelings in others is he who has\nfirst inspired them in himself. For however we strive\nto conceal it, insincerity will always betray itself, and\nthere was never in any man so great eloquence as\nwould not begin to stumble and hesitate so soon as\nhis words ran counter to his inmost thoughts. Now\na bad man cannot help speaking things other than\nhe feels. On the other land, the good will never be\nat a loss for honourable words or fail to find matter\nfull of virtue for utterance, since among his virtues\npractical wisdom will be one. And even though his imagination lacks artifice to lend it charm, its own\nnature will be ornament enough, for if honour dictate\nthe words, we shall find eloquence there as well.\nTherefore, let those that are young, or rather let all\nof us, whatever our age, since it is never too late to\nresolve to follow what is right, strive with all our\nhearts and devote all our efforts to the pursuit of virtue\nand eloquence; and perchance it may be granted to us\nto attain to the perfection that we seek. For since\nnature does not forbid the attainment of either, why\nshould not someone succeed in attaining both together And why should not each of us hope to be\nthat happy man But if our powers are inadequate\nto such achievement, we shall still be the better for\nthe double effort in proportion to the distance which\nwe have advanced toward either goal. At any rate\nlet us banish from our hearts the delusion that\neloquence, the fairest of all things, can be combined\nwith vice. The power of speaking is even to be\naccounted an evil when it is found in evil men; for it\nmakes its possessors yet worse than they were before. I think I hear certain persons for there will\nalways be some who had rather be eloquent than\ngood asking, Now, though\nmy reply to these critics will in the first place be\na defence of my own work, it will also explain what I consider to be the duty of a good man on occasions\nwhen circumstances have caused him to undertake the defence of the guilty. For it is by no\nmeans useless to consider how at times we should\nspeak in defence of falsehood or even of injustice, if\nonly for this reason, that such an investigation will\nenable us to detect and defeat them with the greater\nease, just as the physician who has a thorough\nknowledge of all that can injure the health will be\nall the more skilful in the prescription of remedies.\nFor the Academicians, although they will argue on\neither side of a question, do not thereby commit\nthemselves to taking one of these two views as their\nguide in life to the exclusion of the other, while the\nfamous Carneades, who is said to have spoken at\nRome in the presence of Cato the Censor, and to\nhave argued against justice with no less vigour than\nhe had argued for justice on the preceding day, was\nnot himself an unjust man. But the nature of virtue\nis revealed by vice, its opposite, justice becomes yet\nmore manifest from the contemplation of injustice,\nand there are many other things that are proved by\ntheir contraries. Consequently the schemes of his\nadversaries should be no less well known to the\norator than those of the enemy to a commander in\nthe field. But it is even true, although at first sight\nit seems hard to believe, that there may be sound\nreason why at times a good man who is appearing\nfor the defence should attempt to conceal the truth\nfrom the judge. If any of my readers is surprised\nat my making such a statement although this\nopinion is not of my own invention, but is derived\nfrom those whom antiquity regarded as the greatest\nteachers of wisdom, I would have him reflect that there are many things which are made honourable\nor the reverse not by the nature of the facts, but by\nthe causes from which they spring. For if to slay\na man is often a virtue and to put one's own children\nto death is at times the noblest of deeds, and if it\nis permissible in the public interest to do deeds\nyet more horrible to relate than these, we should\nassuredly take into consideration not solely and\nsimply what is the nature of the case which the\ngood man undertakes to defend, but what is his\nreason and what his purpose in so doing. And first\nof all everyone must allow, what even the sternest\nof the Stoics admit, that the good man will sometimes tell a lie, and further that he will sometimes do\nso for comparatively trivial reasons; for example we\ntell countless lies to sick children for their good and\nmake many promises to them which we do not intend\nto perform. And there is clearly far more justification for lying when it is a question of diverting\nan assassin from his victim or deceiving an enemy\nto save our country. Consequently a practice which\nis at times reprehensible even in slaves, may on\nother occasions be praiseworthy even in a wise man.\nIf this be granted, I can see that there will be many\npossible emergencies such as to justify an orator in\nundertaking cases of a kind which, in the absence of\nany honourable reason, he would have refused to\ntouch. In saying this I do not mean that we should\nbe ready under any circumstances to defend our\nfather, brother or friend when in peril since I\nhold that we should be guided by stricter rules in\nsuch matters, although such contingencies may\nwell cause us no little perplexity, when we have to\ndecide between the rival claims of justice and natural affection. But let us put the problem beyond all\nquestion of doubt. Suppose a man to have plotted\nagainst a tyrant and to be accused of having done so.\nWhich of the two will the orator, as defined by us,\ndesire to save And if he undertakes the defence\nof the accused, will he not employ falsehood with\nno less readiness than the advocate who is defending\na bad case before a jury Again, suppose that the\njudge is likely to condemn acts which were rightly\ndone, unless we can convince him that they were\nnever done. Is not this another case where the\norator will not shrink even from lies, if so he may\nsave one who is not merely innocent, but a praiseworthy citizen Again, suppose that we realise that\ncertain acts are just in themselves, though prejudicial\nto the state under existing circumstances. Shall we\nnot then employ methods of speaking which, despite\nthe excellence of their intention, bear a close resemblance to fraud. Further, no one will hesitate\nfor a moment to hold the view that it is in the\ninterests of the commonwealth that guilty persons\nshould be acquitted rather than punished, if it be\npossible thereby to convert them to a better state of\nmind, a possibility which is generally conceded. If\nthen it is clear to an orator that a man who is guilty\nof the offences laid to his charge will become a good\nman, will he not strive to secure his acquittal\nImagine for example that a skilful commander, without whose aid the state cannot hope to crush its\nenemies, is labouring under a charge which is obviously true will not the common interest irresistibly\nsummon our orator to defend him We know at\nany rate that Fabricius publicly voted for and secured\nthe election to the consulate of Cornelius Rufinus, despite the tact that he was a bad citizen and his\npersonal enemy, merely because he knew that he\nwas a capable general and the state was threatened\nwith war. And when certain persons expressed\ntheir surprise at his conduct, he replied that he had\nrather be robbed by a fellow-citizen than be sold as\na slave by the enemy. Well then, had Fabricius\nbeen an orator, would he not have defended Rufinus\nagainst a charge of peculation, even though his\nguilt were as clear as day I might produce many\nother similar examples, but one of them taken at\nrandom is enough. For my purpose is not to\nassert that such tasks will often be incumbent\non the orator whom I desire to form, but merely to\nshow that, in the event of his being compelled to\ntake such action, it will not invalidate our definition\nof an orator as a And it is necessary also both to teach and learn how\nto establish difficult cases by proof. For often even\nthe best cases have a resemblance to bad and, the\ncharges which tell heavily against an innocent person frequently have a strong resemblance to the\ntruth. Consequently, the same methods of defence\nhave to be employed that would be used if he were\nguilty. Further, there are countless elements which\nare common to both good cases and bad, such as oral\nand documentary evidence, suspicions and opinions,\nall of which have to be established or disposed of in\nthe same way, whether they be true or merely resemble the truth. Therefore, while maintaining his\nintegrity of purpose, the orator will modify his pleading to suit the circumstances. Since then the orator is a good man, and such\ngoodness cannot be conceived as existing apart from virtue, virtue, despite the fact that it is in part\nderived from certain natural impulses, will require to\nbe perfected by instruction. The orator must above\nall things devote his attention to the formation of\nmoral character and must acquire a complete knowledge of all that is just and honourable. For without\nthis knowledge no one can be either a good man or\nskilled in speaking, unless indeed we agree with\nthose who regard morality as intuitive and as owing\nnothing to instruction indeed they go so far as to\nacknowledge that handicrafts, not excluding even\nthose which are most despised among them, can\nonly be acquired by the result of teaching, whereas\nvirtue, which of all gifts to man is that which makes\nhim most near akin to the immortal gods, comes to\nhim without search or effort, as a natural concomitant\nof birth. But can the man who does not know what\nabstinence is, claim to be truly abstinent or brave, if\nhe has never purged his soul of the fears of pain, death\nand superstition or just, it he has never, in language\napproaching that of philosophy, discussed the nature\nof virtue and justice, or of the laws that have been\ngiven to mankind by nature or established among\nindividual peoples and nations What a contempt\nit argues for such themes to regard them as being\nso easy of comprehension However, I pass this by;\nfor I am sure that no one with the least smattering\nof literary culture will have the slightest hesitation\nin agreeing with me. I will proceed to my next\npoint, that no one will achieve sufficient skill even in\nspeaking, unless he makes a thorough study of all\nthe workings of nature and forms his character on\nthe precepts of philosophy and the dictates of reason.\nFor it is with good cause that Lucius Crassus, in the third book of the de Oratore, affirms that all that is\nsaid concerning equity, justice, truth and the good,\nand their opposites, forms part of the studies of an\norator, and that the philosophers, when they exert\ntheir powers of speaking to defend these virtues, are\nusing the weapons of rhetoric, not their own. But\nhe also confesses that the knowledge of these subjects must be sought from the philosophers for the\nreason that, in his opinion, philosophy has more\neffective possession of them. And it is for the same\nreason that Cicero in several of his books and letters\nproclaims that eloquence has its fountain-head in the\nmost secret springs of wisdom, and that consequently\nfor a considerable time the instructors of morals and\nof eloquence were identical. Accordingly this exhortation of mine must not be taken to mean that I\nwish the orator to be a philosopher, since there is no\nother way of life that is further removed from the\nduties of a statesman and the tasks of an orator.\nFor what philosopher has ever been a frequent\nspeaker in the courts or won renown in public\nassemblies Nay, what philosopher has ever taken a\nprominent part in the government of the state, which\nforms the most frequent theme of their instructions\nNone the less I desire that he, whose character I am\nseeking to mould, should be a in the\nRoman sense, that is, one who reveals himself as a true\nstatesman, not in the discussions of the study, but\nin the actual practice and experience of life. But\ninasmuch as the study of philosophy has been\ndeserted by those who have turned to the pursuit of\neloquence, and since philosophy no longer moves in\nits true sphere of action and in the broad daylight of\nthe forum, but has retired first to porches and gymnasia and finally to the gatherings of the schools, all\nthat is essential for an orator, and yet is not taught\nby the professors of eloquence, must undoubtedly be\nsought from those persons in whose possession it\nhas remained. The authors who have discoursed on\nthe nature of virtue must be read through and\nthrough, that the life of the orator may be wedded\nto the knowledge of things human and divine. But\nhow much greater and fairer would such subjects\nappear if those who taught them were also those\nwho could give them most eloquent expression O\nthat the day may dawn when the perfect orator of\nour heart's desire shall claim for his own possession\nthat science that has lost the affection of mankind\nthrough the arrogance of its claims and the vices of\nsome that have brought disgrace upon its virtues,\nand shall restore it to its place in the domain of\neloquence, as though he had been victorious in a\ntrial for the restoration of stolen goods And since\nphilosophy falls into three divisions, physics, ethics\nand dialectic, which, I ask you, of these departments is not closely connected with the task of the\norator Let us reverse the order just given and deal first\nwith the third department which is entirely concerned with words. If it be true that to know the\nproperties of each word, to clear away ambiguities,\nto unravel perplexities, to distinguish between truth\nand falsehood, to prove or to refute as may be\ndesired, all form part of the functions of an orator,\nwho is there that can doubt the truth of my contention I grant that we shall not have to employ\ndialectic with such minute attention to detail when\nwe are pleading in the courts as when we are engaged in philosophical debate, since the orator's\nduty is not merely to instruct, but also to move and\ndelight his audience; and to succeed in doing this\nhe needs a strength, impetuosity and grace as well.\nFor oratory is like a river the current is stronger\nwhen it flows within deep banks and with a mighty\nflood, than when the waters are shallow and broken\nby the pebbles that bar their way. And just as\nthe trainers of the wrestling school do not impart\nthe various throws to their pupils that those who\nhave learnt them may make use of all of them in\nactual wrestling matches for weight and strength\nand wind count for more than these, but that they\nmay have a store from which to draw one or two\nof such tricks, as occasion may offer; even so the\nscience of dialectic, or if you prefer it of disputation, while it is often useful in definition, inference,\ndifferentiation, resolution of ambiguity, distinction\nand classification, as also in luring on or entangling\nour opponents, yet if it claim to assume the entire\ndirection of the struggles of the forum, will merely\nstand in the way of arts superior to itself and by its\nvery subtlety will exhaust the strength that has\nbeen pared down to suit its limitations. As a\nresult you will find that certain persons who show\nastonishing skill in philosophical debate, as soon as\nthey quit the sphere of their quibbles, are as helpless in any case that demands more serious pleading\nas those small animals which, though nimble enough\nin a confined space, are easily captured in an open\nfield. Proceeding to moral philosophy or ethics, we may\nnote that it at any rate is entirely suited to the\norator. For vast as is the variety of cases since in them, as I have pointed out in previous books, we seek\nto discover certain points by conjecture, reach our\nconclusions in others by means of definition, dispose\nof others on legal grounds' or by raising the question of competence, while other points are established by syllogism and others involve contradictions or are diversely interpreted owing to some\nambiguity of language, there is scarcely a single\none which does not at some point or another involve\nthe discussion of equity and virtue, while there are\nalso, as everyone knows, not a few which turn\nentirely on questions of quality. Again in deliberative assemblies how can we advise a policy without\nraising the question of what is honourable Nay,\neven the third department of oratory, which is\nconcerned with the tasks of praise and denunciation,\nmust without a doubt deal with questions of right\nand wrong. For the orator will assuredly have\nmuch to say on such topics as justice, fortitude,\nabstinence, self-control and piety. But the good\nman, who has come to the knowledge of these things\nnot by mere hearsay, as though they were just words\nand names for his tongue to employ, but has grasped\nthe meaning of virtue and acquired a true feeling for\nit, will never be perplexed when he has to think out\na problem, but will speak out truly what he\nknows. Since, however, general questions are always\nmore important than special for the particular is\ncontained in the universal, while the universal is\nnever to be regarded as something superimposed on\nthe particular, everyone will readily admit that the\nstudies of which we are speaking are pre-eminently\nconcerned with general questions. Further, since\nthere are numerous points which require to be determined by appropriate and concise definitions\nhence the definitive basis of cases, it is surely\ndesirable that the orator should be instructed in\nsuch things by those who have devoted special\nattention to the subject. Again, does not every\nquestion of law turn either on the precise meaning\nof words, the discussion of equity, or conjecture as\nto the intentionsubjects which in part encroach on\nthe domain of dialectic and in part on that of ethics\nConsequently all oratory involves a natural admixture\nof all these philosophic elementsat least, that is to\nsay, all oratory that is worthy of the name. For\nmere garrulity that is ignorant of all such learning\nmust needs go astray, since its guides are either\nnon-existent or false. Physics on the other hand is far richer than the\nother branches of philosophy, if viewed from the\nstandpoint of providing exercise in speaking, in\nproportion as a loftier inspiration is required to\nspeak of things divine than of things human; and\nfurther it includes within its scope the whole of\nethics, which as we have shown are essential to the\nvery existence of oratory. For, if the world is\ngoverned by providence, it will certainly be the\nduty of all good men to bear their part in the\nadministration of the state. If the origin of our\nsouls be divine, we must win our way towards virtue\nand abjure the service of the lusts of our earthly\nbody. Are not these themes which the orator will\nfrequently be called upon to handle Again there\nare questions concerned with auguries and oracles\nor any other religious topic all of them subjects\nthat have often given rise to the most important debates in the senate on which the orator will have to discourse, if he is also to be the statesman we\nwould have him be. And finally, how can we conceive of any real eloquence at all proceeding from\na man who is ignorant of all that is best in the\nworld If our reason did not make these facts\nobvious, we should still be led by historical examples\nto believe their truth. For Pericles, whose eloquence, despite the fact that it has left no visible\nrecord for posterity, was none the less, if we may\nbelieve the historians and that free-speaking tribe,\nthe old comic poets, endowed with almost incredible\nforce, is known to have been a pupil of the physicist\nAnaxagoras, while Demosthenes, greatest of all the\norators of Greece, sat at the feet of Plato. As for\nCicero, he has often proclaimed the fact that he\nowed less to the schools of rhetoric than to the\nwalks of Academe nor would he ever have developed\nsuch amazing fertility of talent, had he bounded his\ngenius by the limits of the forum and not by the\nfrontiers of nature herself. But this leads me to another question as to which\nschool of philosophy is like to prove of most service\nto oratory, although there are only a few that can be\nsaid to contend for this honour. For in the first\nplace Epicurus banishes us from his presence without\nmore ado, since he bids all his followers to fly from\nlearning in the swiftest ship that they can find.\nNor would Aristippus, who regards the highest good\nas consisting in physical pleasure, be likely to exhort\nus to the toils entailed by our study. And what\npart can Pyrrho have in the work that is before us\nFor he will have doubts as to whether there exist\njudges to address, accused to defend, or a senate\nwhere he can be called upon to speak his opinion. Some authorities hold that the Academy will be the\nmost useful school, on the ground that its habit of\ndisputing on both sides of a question approaches\nmost nearly to the actual practice of the courts.\nAnd by way of proof they add the fact that this\nschool has produced speakers highly renowned for\ntheir eloquence. The Peripatetics also make it their\nboast that they have a form of study which is near\nakin to oratory. For it was with them in the main\nthat originated the practice of declaiming on general\nquestions by way of exercise. The Stoics, though\ndriven to admit that, generally speaking, their teachers\nhave been deficient both in fullness and charm of\neloquence, still contend that no men can prove more\nacutely or draw conclusions with greater subtlety\nthan themselves. But all these arguments take\nplace within their own circle, for, as though they\nwere tied by some solemn oath or held fast in the\nbonds of some superstitious belief, they consider that\nit is a crime to abandon a conviction once formed.\nOn the other hand, there is no need for an orator to\nswear allegiance to any one philosophic code. For\nlie has a greater and nobler aim, to which he directs\nall his efforts with as much zeal as if he were a\ncandidate for office, since he is to be made perfect\nnot only in the glory of a virtuous life, but in that of\neloquence as well. He will consequently select as\nhis models of eloquence all the greatest masters of\noratory, and will choose the noblest precepts and\nthe most direct road to virtue as the means for\nthe formation of an upright character. He will\nneglect no form of exercise, but will devote special\nattention to those which are of the highest and\nfairest nature. For what subject can be found more fully adapted to a rich and weighty eloquence than\nthe topics of virtue, politics, providence, the origin\nof the soul and friendship The themes which tend\nto elevate mind and language alike are questions\nsuch as what things are truly good, what means there\nare of assuaging fear, restraining the passions and\nlifting us and the soul that came from heaven clear\nof the delusions of the common herd. But it is desirable that we should not restrict our\nstudy to the precepts of philosophy alone. It is still\nmore important that we should know and ponder\ncontinually all the noblest sayings and deeds that have\nbeen handed down to us from ancient times. And\nassuredly we shall nowhere find a larger or more\nremarkable store of these than in the records of our\nown country. Who will teach courage, justice,\nloyalty, self-control, simplicity, and contempt of\ngrief and pain better than men like Fabricius, Curius,\nRegulus, Decius, Mucius and countless others For\nif the Greeks bear away the palm for moral precepts,\nRome can produce more striking examples of moral\nperformance, which is a far greater thing. But the\nman who does not believe that it is enough to fix\nhis eyes merely on his own age and his own transitory\nlife, but regards the space allotted for an honourable\nlife and the course in which glory's race is run as\nconditioned solely by the memory of posterity, will\nnot rest content with a mere knowledge of the\nevents of history. No, it is from the thought of\nposterity that he must inspire his soul with justice\nand derive that freedom of spirit which it is his duty\nto display when he pleads in the courts or gives\ncounsel in the senate. No man will ever be the\nconsummate orator of whom we are in quest unless he has both the knowledge and the courage to speak\nin accordance with the promptings of honour. III. Our orator will also require a knowledge of\ncivil law and of the custom and religion of the state\nin whose life he is to bear his part. For how will he\nbe able to advise either in public or in private, if he\nis ignorant of all the main elements that go to make\nthe state How can he truthfully call himself an\nadvocate if he has to go to others to acquire that\nknowledge which is all-important in the courts\nHe will be little better than if he were a reciter of\nthe poets. For he will be a mere transmitter of the\ninstructions that others have given him, it will be on\nthe authority of others that he propounds what he\nasks the judge to believe, and he whose duty it is to\nsuccour the litigant will himself be in need of succour.\nIt is true that at times this may be effected with but\nlittle inconvenience, if what he advances for the\nedification of the judge has been taught him and\ncomposed in the seclusion of his study and learnt by\nheart there like other elements of the case. But\nwhat will he do, when he is confronted by unexpected\nproblems such as frequently arise in the actual\ncourse of pleading Will he not disgrace himself by looking round and asking the junior counsel\nwho sit on the benches behind him for advice Can\nlie hope to get a thorough grasp of such information\nat the very moment when he is required to produce\nit in his speech Can he make his assertions with\nconfidence or speak with native simplicity as though\nhis arguments were his own Grant that he may do\nso in his actual speech. But what will he do in a\ndebate, when he has continually to meet fresh points\nraised by his opponent and is given no time to learn up his case What will do, if he has no legal\nexpert to advise him or if his prompter through\ninsufficient knowledge of the subject provides him\nwith information that is false It is the most serious\ndrawback of such ignorance, that he will always\nbelieve that his adviser knows what he is talking\nabout. I am not ignorant of the generally prevailing custom, nor have I forgotten those who sit by\nour store-chests and provide weapons for the pleader\nI know too that the Greeks did likewise hence\nthe name of pragmaticus which was bestowed on\nsuch persons. But I am speaking of an orator, who\nowes it as a duty to his case to serve it not merely\nby the loudness of his voice, but by all other means\nthat may be of assistance to it. Consequently I do\nnot wish my orator to be helpless, if it so chance\nthat he puts in an appearance for the preliminary\nproceedings to which the hour before the commencement of the trial is allotted, or to be unskilful in\nthe preparation and production of evidence. For\nwho, sooner than himself, should prepare the points\nwhich he wishes to be brought out when he is\npleading You might as well suppose that the\nqualifications of a successful general consist merely\nin courage and energy in the field of battle and skill\nin meeting all the demands of actual conflict, while\nsuffering him to be ignorant of the methods of levying troops, mustering and equipping his forces,\narranging for supplies or selecting a suitable position\nfor his camp, despite the fact that preparation for\nwar is an essential preliminary for its successful\nconduct. And yet such a general would bear a\nvery close resemblance to the advocate who leaves\nmuch of the detail that is necessary for success to the care of others, more especially in view of the\nfact that this, the most necessary element in the\nmanagement of a case, is not as difficult as it may\nperhaps seem to outside observers. For every point\nof law, which is certain, is based either on written\nlaw or accepted custom if, on the other hand, the\npoint is doubtful, it must be examined in the light\nof equity. Laws which are either written or founded\non accepted custom present no difficulty, since they\ncall merely for knowledge and make no demand on\nthe imagination. On the other hand, the points explained in the rulings of the legal experts turn either\non the interpretation of words or on the distinction\nbetween right and wrong. To understand the meaning of each word is either common to all sensible\nmen or the special possession of the orator, while\nthe demands of equity are known to every good\nman. Now I regard the orator above all as being\na man of virtue and good sense, who will not be\nseriously troubled, after having devoted himself to\nthe study of that which is excellent by nature, if\nsome legal expert disagrees with him; for even they\nare allowed to disagree among themselves. But if\nhe further wishes to know the views of everyone,\nhe will require to read, and reading is the least\nlaborious of' all the tasks that fall to the student's\nlot. Moreover, if the class of legal experts is as a rule\ndrawn from those who, in despair of making successful pleaders, have taken refuge with the law,\nhow easy it must be for an orator to know what\nthose succeed in learning, who by their own confession are incapable of becoming orators But\nMarcus Cato was at once a great orator and an\nexpert lawyer, while Scaevola and Servius Sulpicius were universally allowed to be eloquent as well.\nAnd Cicero not merely possessed a sufficient supply of\nlegal knowledge to serve his needs when pleading,\nbut actually began to write on the subject, so that\nit is clear that an orator has not merely time to\nlearn, but even to teach the law. Let no one, however, regard the advice I have\ngiven as to the attention due to the development\nof character and the study of the law as being\nimpugned by the fact that we are familiar with\nmany who, because they were weary of the toil\nentailed on those who seek to scale the heights\nof eloquence, have betaken themselves to the study\nof law as a refuge for their indolence. Some of\nthese transfer their attention to the praetor's edicts\nor the civil law, and have preferred to become\nspecialists in formulae, or legalists, as Cicero calls\nthem, on the pretext of choosing a more useful\nbranch of study, whereas their real motive was its\ncomparative easiness. Others are the victims of a\nmore arrogant form of sloth; they assume a stern\nair and let their beards grow, and, as though despising the precepts of oratory, sit for a while in\nthe schools of the philosophers, that, by an assumption of a severe mien before the public gaze and by\nan affected contempt of others they may assert their\nmoral superiority, while leading a life of debauchery\nat home. For philosophy may be counterfeited, but\neloquence never. Above all, our orator should be equipped\nwith a rich store of examples both old and new\nand he ought not merely to know those which are\nrecorded in history or transmitted by oral tradition\nor occur from day to day, but should not neglect even those fictitious examples invented by the great\npoets. For while the former have the authority of\nevidence or even of legal decisions, the latter also\neither have the warrant of antiquity or are regarded\nas having been invented by great men to serve as\nlessons to the world. He should therefore be acquainted with as many examples as possible. It is\nthis which gives old age so much authority, since\nthe old are believed to have a larger store of knowledge and experience, as Homer so frequently bears\nwitness. But we must not wait till the evening of\nour days, since study has this advantage that, as far\nas knowledge of facts is concerned, it is capable of\ngiving the impression that we have lived in ages\nlong gone by. Such are the instruments of which I promised\nto give account, the instruments, that is, not merely\nof the art, as some have held, but of the orator himself. These are the weapons that he should have\nready to his hand, this the knowledge with which he\nmust be equipped, while it must be supplemented by\na ready store of words and figures, power of imagination, skill in arrangement, retentiveness of memory\nand grace of delivery. But of all these qualities the\nhighest is that loftiness of soul which fear cannot\ndismay nor uproar terrify nor the authority of the\naudience fetter further than the respect which is\ntheir due. For although the vices which are its\nopposites, such as arrogance, temerity, impudence\nand presumption, are all positively obnoxious, still\nwithout constancy, confidence and courage, art, study\nand proficiency will be of no avail. You might as\nwell put weapons into the hands of the unwarlike\nand the coward. It is indeed with some reluctance, as it may give rise to misunderstanding, that I say\nthat even modesty which, though a fault in itself, is\nan amiable failing which may easily be the mother of\nvirtues is on occasion an impediment and has\nfrequently caused the fruits of genius and study to\nconsume away in the mildew of obscurity merely\nbecause they have never been displayed to the public\nday. But in case any of my readers should still lack\nskill to distinguish the precise meaning of each\nword, I would have him know that it is not honest\nshame that is the object of my criticism, but that\nexcess of modesty which is really a form of fear\ndeterring the soul from doing what is its duty to do,\nand resulting in confusion of mind, regret that our\ntask was ever begun, and sudden silence. For who\ncan hesitate to give the name of fault to a feeling\nthat makes a man ashamed to do what is right On\nthe other hand, I am not unwilling that the man who\nhas got to make a speech should show signs of\nnervousness when he rises to his feet, should change\ncolour and make it clear that he feels the risks of his\nposition indeed, if these symptoms do not occur\nnaturally, it will be necessary to simulate them.\nBut the feeling that stirs us should be due to the\nrealisation of the magnitude of our task and not to\nfear we should be moved, but not to the extent of\ncollapsing. But the best remedy for such excess\nof modesty is confidence however great our natural\ntimidity of mien, we shall find strength and support\nin the consciousness of the nobility of our task. There are also those natural instruments which, as\nI mentioned above, may be further improved by\ncare, such as voice, lungs and grace of carriage\nand movement, all of which are of such importance as frequently to give a speaker the reputation for\ntalent. Our own age has had orators of greater\nresource and power, but Trachalus appeared to stand\nout above all his contemporaries, when he was speaking. Such was the elect produced by his lofty\nstature, the fire of his eye, the dignity of his brow,\nthe excellence of his gesture, coupled with a voice\nwhich was not almost a tragedian's, as Cicero\ndemands that it should be, but surpassed the voice\nof all tragedians that I have ever heard. At any\nrate I remember that, when he was speaking in the\nBasilica Julia before the first tribunal, and the four\npanels of judges were assembled as usual and the\nwhole building was full of noise, he could still be\nheard and understood and applauded from all four\ntribunals at once, a fact which was not complimentary\nto the other pleaders. But gifts like these are such\nas all may pray for and few are happy enough to\nattain. And if we cannot achieve such fortune, we\nmust even be content to be heard by the court which\nwe are addressing. Such then should the orator be,\nand such are the things which he should know. The age at which the orator should begin to\nplead will of course depend on the development of\nhis strength. I shall not specify it further, since it\nis clear that Demosthenes pleaded against his\nguardians while he was still a mere boy, Calvus,\nCaesar and Pollio all undertook cases of the first\nimportance before they were old enough to be\nqualified for the quaestorship, others are said to have\npleaded while still wearing the garb of boyhood,\nand Augustus Caesar delivered a funeral oration over\nhis grandmother from the public rostra when he was\nonly twelve years old. In my opinion we should aim at a happy mean. The unripe brow of boyhood\nshould not be prematurely robbed of its ingenuous\nair nor should the young speaker's powers be brought\nbefore the public while yet unformed, since such a\npractice leads to a contempt for study, lays the\nfoundations of impudence and induces a fault which\nis pernicious in all departments of life, namely, a self-confidence that is not justified by the speaker's\nresources. On the other hand, it is undesirable to\npostpone the apprenticeship of the bar till old age\nfor the fear of appearing in public grows daily and\nthe magnitude of the task on which we must venture\ncontinually increases and we waste time deliberating\nwhen we should begin, till we find it is too late to\nbegin at all. Consequently it is desirable that the\nfruit of our studies should be brought before the\npublic eye while it is still fresh and sweet, while it\nmay hope for indulgence and be secure of a kindly\ndisposition in the audience, while boldness is not\nunbecoming and youth compensates for all defects\nand boyish extravagance is regarded as a sign of\nnatural vigour. Take for example the whole of the\nwell-known passage from Cicero's defence of Sextus\nRoscius etc. This passage was delivered at the age of\ntwenty-six amid loud applause from the audience,\nbut in later years he acknowledges that the ferment\nof youth has died down and his style been clarified\nwith age. And, indeed, however much private study\nmay contribute to success, there is still a peculiar\nproficiency that the courts alone can give for there\nthe atmosphere is changed and the reality of the peril puts a different complexion on things, while, if\nit is impossible to combine the two, practice without\ntheory is more useful than theory without practice.\nConsequently, some who have grown old in the\nschools lose their heads when confronted by the\nnovelty of the law courts and wish that it were\npossible to reproduce all the conditions under which\nthey delivered their exercises. But there sits the\njudge in silence, their opponent bellows at them, no\nrash utterance passes unnoticed and all assumptions\nmust be proved, the clock cuts short the speech that\nhas been laboriously pieced together at the cost of\nhours of study both by day and night, and there are\ncertain cases which require simplicity of language and\nthe abandonment of the perpetual bombast of the\nschools, a fact which these fluent fellows completely\nfail to realise. And so you will find some persons\nwho regard themselves as too eloquent to speak in\nthe courts. On the other hand, the man, whom we\nconducted to the forum while still young and in the\ncharm of immaturity, should begin with as easy and\nfavourable a case as may be just as the cubs of wild\nbeasts are brought up to start with on softer\nforms of prey, and should not proceed straight\nfrom this commencement to plead case after case\nwithout a break, or cause his talents to set and\nharden while they still require nourishment; on the\ncontrary, as soon as he has come to realise the nature\nof the conflicts in which he will have to engage and\nthe object to which his studies should be directed, he\nshould take an interval of rest and refreshment.\nThus, at an age to which boldness is still natural, he\nwill find it easy to get over the timidity which invariably accompanies the period of apprenticeship, and will not, on the other hand, carry his boldness so far\nas to lead him to despise the difficulties of his task.\nThis was the method employed by Cicero for when\nhe had already won a distinguished position at the\nbar of his day, he took ship to Asia and there studied\nunder a number of professors of philosophy and\nrhetoric, but above all under Apollonius Molon,\nwhose lectures he had attended at Rome and to\nwhom he now at Rhodes entrusted the refashioning\nand recasting of his style. It is only when theory\nand practice are brought into a perfect harmony\nthat the orator reaps the reward of all his study. When our orator has developed his strength\nto such a pitch that it is equal to every kind of confact in which he may be called upon to bear his part,\nhis first consideration should be to exercise care in\nthe choice of the cases which he proposes to undertake. A good man will undoubtedly prefer defence\nto prosecution, but he will not have such a rooted\nobjection to the task of accuser as to disregard his\nduty towards the state or towards individuals and\nrefuse to call any man to render an account of his\nway of life. For the laws themselves would be\npowerless without the assistance of advocates equal\nto the task of supporting them; and to regard it as a\nsin to demand the punishment of crime is almost equivalent to the sanctioning of crime, while it is certainly\ncontrary to the interest of the good to give the\nwicked free leave to work their will. Therefore, our\norator will not suffer the complaints of our allies, the\ndeath of friends or kinsmen, or conspiracies that\nthreaten the common weal to go unavenged, while\nhis conduct will be governed not by a passion to\nsecure the punishment of the guilty, but by the desire to correct vice and reform morals. For fear\nis the only means of restraining those who cannot\nbe led to better ways by the voice of reason. Consequently, while to devote one's life to the task of\naccusation, and to be tempted by the hope of reward\nto bring the guilty to trial is little better than making\none's living by highway robbery, none the less to rid\none's country of the pests that gnaw its vitals is\nconduct worthy of comparison with that of heroes,\nwho champion their country's cause in the field of\nbattle. For this reason men who were leaders of the\nstate have not refused to undertake this portion of\nan orator's duty, and even young men of high rank\nhave been regarded as giving their country a pledge\nof their devotion by accusing bad citizens, since it\nwas thought that their hatred of evil and their\nreadiness to incur enmity were proofs of their confidence in their own rectitude. Such action was\ntaken by Hortensius, the Luculli, Sulpicius, Cicero,\nCaesar and many others, among them both the Catos,\nof whom one was actually called the Wise, while if\nthe other is not regarded as wise, I do not know of\nany that can claim the title after him. On the other\nhand, this same orator of ours will not defend all and\nsundry that haven of safety which his eloquence\nprovides will never be opened to pirates as it is to\nothers, and he will be led to undertake cases mainly\nby consideration of their nature. However, since\none man cannot undertake the cases of all litigants\nwho are not, as many undoubtedly are, dishonest, he\nwill be influenced to some extent by the character\nof the persons who recommend clients to his protection and also by the character of the litigants\nthemselves, and will allow himself to be moved by the wishes of all virtuous men; for a good man will\nnaturally have such for his most intimate friends.\nBut he must put away from him two kinds of\npretentious display, the one consisting in the\nofficious proffering of his services to the powerful\nagainst those of meaner position, and the other,\nwhich is even more obtrusive, in deliberately supporting inferiors against those of high degree. For a\ncase is not rendered either just or the reverse by the\nsocial position of the parties engaged. Nor, again,\nwill a sense of shame deter him from throwing over\na case which he has undertaken in the belief that it\nhad justice on its side, but which his study of the\nfacts has shown to be unjust, although before doing\nso he should give his client his true opinion on the\ncase. For, if we judge aright, there is no greater\nbenefit that we can confer on our clients than this,\nthat we should not cheat them by giving them empty\nhopes of success. On the other hand, no client that\ndoes not take his advocate into his counsel deserves\nthat advocate's assistance, and it is certainly unworthy\nof our ideal orator that he should wittingly defend\ninjustice. For if he is led to defend what is false\nby any of the motives which I mentioned above, his\nown action will still be honourable. It is an open question whether he should never\ndemand a fee for his services. To decide the\nquestion at first sight would be the act of a fool.\nFor we all know that by far the most honourable\ncourse, and the one which is most in keeping with a\nliberal education and that temper of mind which we\ndesiderate, is not to sell our services nor to debase\nthe value of such a boon as eloquence, since there\nare not a few things which come to be regarded as cheap, merely because they have a price set upon\nthem. This much even the blind can see, as the\nsaying is, and no one who is the possessor of sufficient\nwealth to satisfy his needs and that does not imply\nany great opulence will seek to secure an income\nby such methods without laying himself open to the\ncharge of meanness. On the other hand, if his\ndomestic circumstances are such as to require some\naddition to his income to enable him to meet the\nnecessary demands upon his purse, there is not a\nphilosopher who would forbid him to accept this form\nof recompense for his services, since collections were\nmade even on behalf of Socrates, and Zeno, Cleanthes\nand Chrysippus took fees from their pupils. Nor\ncan I see how we can turn a more honest penny than\nby performance of the most honourable of tasks and\nby accepting money from those to whom we have\nrendered the most signal services and who, if they\nmade no return for what we have done for them,\nwould show themselves undeserving to have been\ndefended by us. Nay, it is not only just, but\nnecessary that this should be so, since the duties of\nadvocacy and the bestowal of every minute of our\ntime on the affairs of others deprive us of all other\nmeans of making money. But we must none the\nless observe the happy mean, and it makes no small\ndifference from whom we take payment, what payment we demand, and how long we continue to do\nso. As for the piratical practice of bargaining and\nthe scandalous traffic of those who proportion their\nfees to the peril in which their would-be client\nstands, such a procedure will be eschewed even by\nthose who are more than half scoundrels, more\nespecially since the advocate who devotes himself to the defence of good men and worthy causes will\nhave nothing to fear from ingratitude. And even if\na client should prove ungrateful, it is better that he\nshould be the sinner and not our orator. To conelude, then, the orator will not seek to make more\nmoney than is sufficient for his needs, and even if he\nis poor, he will not regard his payment as a fee, but\nrather as the expression of the principle that one\ngood turn deserves another, since he will be well\naware that he has conferred far more than he receives.\nFor it does not follow that because his services\nought not to be sold, they should therefore be\nunremunerated. Finally, gratitude is primarily the\nbusiness of the debtor. We have next to consider how a case should\nbe studied, since such study is the foundation of\noratory. There is no one so destitute of all talent\nas, after making himself thoroughly familiar with all\nthe facts of his case, to be unable at least to communicate those facts to the judge. But those who\ndevote any serious attention to such study are very\nfew indeed. For, to say nothing of those careless\nadvocates who are quite indifferent as to what the\npivot of the whole case may be, provided only there\nare points which, though irrelevant to the case, will\ngive them the opportunity of declaiming in thunderous tones on the character of persons involved or\ndeveloping some commonplace, there are some who\nare so perverted by vanity that, on the oft-repeated\npretext that they are occupied by other business,\nthey bid their client come to them on the day preceding the trial or early on the morning of the day\nitself, and sometimes even boast that they learnt up\ntheir case while sitting in court; while others by way of creating an impression of extraordinary talent,\nand to make it seem that they arc quick in the uptake, pretend that they have grasped the facts of\nthe case and understand the situation almost before\nthey have heard what it is, and then after chanting\nout some long and fluent discourse which has nought\nto do either with the judge or their client, but\nawakens the clamorous applause of the audience,\nthey are escorted home through the forum, perspiring\nat every pore and attended by flocks of enthusiastic\nfriends. Further, I would not even tolerate the\naffectation of those who insist that their friends, and\nnot themselves, should be instructed in the facts\nof the case, though this is a less serious evil, if the\nfriends can be relied upon to learn and supply the\nfacts correctly. But who can give such effective\nstudy to the case as the advocate himself How\ncan the intermediary, the go-between or interpreter,\ndevote himself whole-heartedly to the study of other\nmen's cases, when those who have got to do the\nactual pleading do not think it worth while to get\nup their own On the other hand, it is a most\npernicious practice to rest content with a written\nstatement of the case composed either by the litigant\nwho betakes himself to an advocate because he finds\nthat his own powers are not equal to the conduct of\nhis case, or by some member of that class of legal\nadvisers who admit that they are incapable of pleading, and then proceed to take upon themselves the\nmost difficult of all the tasks that confront the pleader.\nFor if a man is capable of judging what should be\nsaid, what concealed, what avoided, altered or even\ninvented, why should he not appear as orator himself,\nsince he performs the far more difficult feat of making an orator Such persons would not, however, do so\nmuch harm if they would only put down all the\nfacts as they occurred. But as it is, they add suggestions of their own, put their own construction on\nthe facts and insert inventions which are far more\ndamaging than the unvarnished truth. And then\nthe advocate as a rule, on receiving the document,\nregards it as a crime to make any alteration, and\nkeeps to it as faithfully as if it were a theme set for\ndeclamation in the schools. The sequel is that they\nare tripped up and have to learn from their opponents the case which they refused to learn from their\nown clients. We should therefore above all allow\nthe parties concerned ample time for an interview in\na place free from interruption, and should even\nexhort them to set forth on the spot all the facts in\nas many words as they may choose to use and allowing them to go as far back as they please. For it is\nless of a drawback to listen to a number of irrelevant\nfacts than to be left in ignorance of essentials.\nMoreover, the orator will often detect both the evil\nand its remedy in facts which the litigant regarded\nas devoid of all importance, one way or the other.\nFurther, the advocate who has got to plead the case\nshould not put such excessive confidence in his\npowers of memory as to disdain to jot down what he\nhas heard. Nor should one hearing be regarded as sufficient.\nThe litigant should be made to repeat his statements\nat least once, not merely because certain points may\nhave escaped him on the occasion of his first statement, as is extremely likely to happen if, as is often\nthe case, he is a man of no education, but also that\nwe may note whether he sticks to what he originally said. For a large number of clients lie, and hold\nforth, not as if they were instructing their advocate\nin the facts of the case, but as if they were pleading\nwith a judge. Consequently we must never be too\nready to believe them, but must test them in every\nway, try to confuse them and draw them out. For\njust as doctors have to do more than treat the\nailments which meet the eye, and need also to\ndiscover those which he hid, since their patients\noften conceal the truth, so the advocate must look\nout for more points than his client discloses to him.\nAfter he considers that he has given a sufficiently\npatient hearing to the latter's statements, he must\nassume another character and adopt the rle of his\nopponent, urging every conceivable objection that a\ndiscussion of the kind which we are considering may\npermit. The client must be subjected to a hosthe\ncross-examination and given no peace for by enquiring into everything, we shall sometimes come\nupon the truth where we least expect it. In fact, the advocate who is most successful in\ngetting up his case is he who is incredulous. For\nthe client promises everything the people, he says,\nwill bear witness to the truth of what he says, he can\nproduce documentary evidence at a moment's notice\nand there are some points which he says his opponent\nwill not deny. It is therefore necessary to look into\nevery document connected with the case, and where\nthe mere sight of them is not sufficient, they must\nbe read through. For very frequently they are\neither not at all what the client alleged them to be,\nor contain less, or are mixed up with elements that\nmay damage our case, or prove more than is required\nand are likely to detract from their credibility just because they are so extravagant. Further, it will\noften be found that the thread is broken or the seal\ntampered with or the signatures unsupported by\nwitnesses. And unless you discover such facts at\nhome, they will take you by surprise in court and\ntrip you up, doing you more harm by forcing you to\nabandon them than they would have done had they\nnever been promised you. There are also a number\nof points which the client regards as irrelevant to\nhis case, which the advocate will be able to elicit,\nprovided he go carefully through all the of argument which I have already described.\nNow though, for reasons already mentioned, it is\nmost undesirable that he should hunt for and try\nevery single one of those, while actually engaged in\npleading his case, it is most necessary in the preliminary study of the case to leave no stone unturned to\ndiscover the character of the persons involved, the\ncircumstances of time and place, the customs and\ndocuments concerned, and the rest, from which we\nmay not merely deduce the proofs known as artificial,\nbut may also discover which witnesses are most to be\nfeared and the best method of refuting them. For\nit makes a great difference whether it be envy,\nhatred or contempt that forms the chief obstacle to\nthe success of the defence, since of these obstacles\nthe first tells most against superiors, the second\nagainst equals, and the third against those of low\ndegree. Having thus given a thorough examination\nto the case and clearly envisaged all those points\nwhich will tell for or against his client, the orator\nmust then place himself in the position of a third\nperson, namely, the judge, and imagine that the case is being pleaded before himself, and assume\nthat the point which would have carried most weight\nwith himself, had he been trying the case, is likely\nto have the greatest influence with the actual judge.\nThus he will rarely be deceived as to the result of\nthe trial, or, if he is, it will be the fault of the judge. As regards the points to be observed in the\nactual pleading, I have dealt with these in every\nportion of this work, but there still remain a few on\nwhich I must touch as being specially appropriate to\nthe present place, since they are concerned not so\nmuch with the art of speaking as with the duties\nof the advocate. Above all it is important that he\nshould never, like so many, be led by a desire to win\napplause to neglect the interest of the actual case.\nIt is not always the duty of generals in the field to\nlead their armies through flat and smiling country\nit will often be necessary to cross rugged mountain\nranges, to storm cities placed on inaccessible cliffs or\nrendered difficult of access by elaborate fortifications.\nSimilarly oratory will always be glad of the opportunity of manuvring in all its freedom and delighting the spectator by the deployment of its full\nstrength for conflict in the open field; but if it is\nforced to enter the tortuous defiles of the law, or\ndark places whence the truth has to be dragged\nforth, it will not go prancing in front of the enemy's\nlines nor launch its shafts of quivering and passionate\nepigram of the fashion that is now so popular, but\nwill wage war by means of sap and mine and ambush\nand all the tactics of secrecy. None of these\nmethods win applause during their actual execution\nthe reward comes after they have been carried to a\nsuccessful termination, when even the most ambitious will reap a richer recompense than they could ever\nhave secured by other means. For so soon as the\nthunders of applause awakened among their admirers\nby these affected declamatory displays have died\naway, the glory of true virtue rises again with\nrenewed splendour, the judges do not conceal who\nit is has moved them, the well-trained orator wins\ntheir belief and oratory receives its only genuine\ntribute, the praise accorded it when its task is done.\nThe old orators indeed used to conceal their eloquence, a method which is recommended by Marcus\nAntonius, as a means of securing that the speaker's\nwords should carry conviction and of masking the\nadvocate's real designs. But the truth is that the\neloquence of those days was capable of concealment,\nfor it had not yet attained that splendour of diction\nwhich makes it impossible to hide its light under a\nbushel. Therefore artifice and stratagem should be\nmasked, since detection in such cases spells failure.\nThus far, and thus only, may eloquence hope to enjoy\nthe advantages of secrecy. But when we come to\nconsider the choice of words, the weight essential\nto general reflexions and the elegance demanded by\nfigures, we are confronted by elements which must\neither strike the attention or be condemned to nonexistence. But the very fact that they strike the\nattention is a reason why they should not flaunt\nthemselves obtrusively. And, if we have to make\nthe choice, I should prefer that it should be the\ncause, and not the orator, to which we award our\npraise. Nevertheless, the true orator will achieve\nthe distinction of seeming to speak with all the\nexcellence that an excellent case deserves. One\nthing may be regarded as certain, that no one can plead worse than he who wins applause despite the\ndisapproval meted out to his case. For the inevitable\nconclusion is that the applause must have been\nevoked by something having no connexion with the\ncase. Further, the true orator will not turn up his\nnose at cases of minor importance on the ground of\ntheir being beneath his dignity or as being likely\nto detract from his reputation because the subject\nmatter does not allow his genius full scope. For the\nstrongest reason for undertaking a case is to be fund\nin our duty towards our clients nay, we should even\ndesire the suits in which our friends are involved to\nhe as unimportant as possible, and remember that the\nadvocate who gives an adequate presentment to his\ncase, has spoken exceeding well. But there are so he who, even although the cases\nwhich they have undertaken give but small scope for\neloquence, none the less trick it out with matter\ndrawn from without and, if all else fails, fill up the\ngaps in their case with abuse of their opponents,\ntrue if possible, but false if necessary, the sole consideration that weighs with them being that it affords\nexercise for their talents and is likely to win applause\nduring its delivery. Such conduct seems to me so\nunworthy of our perfect orator that, in my opinion,\nhe will not even bring true charges against his\nopponents unless the case demand. For it is a\ndog's eloquence, as Appius says, to undertake the\ntask of abusing one's opponent, and they who do so\nshould steel themselves in advance to the prospect\nof being targets for like abuse themselves, since\nthose who adopt this style of pleading are frequently\nattacked themselves, and there can at any rate be\nno doubt that the litigant pays dearly for the violence of his advocate. But such faults are less serious than\nthat which lies deep in the soul itself, making the\nevil speaker to differ from the evil doer only in\nrespect of opportunity. It is not uncommon for\nthe litigant to demand a base and inhuman gratification of his rancour, such as not a single man among\nthe audience will approve, for it is on revenge rather\nthan on protection that his heart is set. But in this,\nas in a number of other points, it is the duty of the\norator to refuse to comply with his clients' desires.\nFor how can a man with the least degree of gentlemanly feeling consent to make a brutal attack merely\nbecause another desires it And yet there are some\nwho take pleasure in directing their onslaughts\nagainst their opponents' counsel as well, a practice\nwhich, unless they have deserved such attacks, shows\nan inhuman disregard of the duties incumbent on the\nprofession, and is not merely useless to the speaker\nsince he thereby gives his opponent the right to\nreply in the same strain, but contrary to the\ninterests of his case, since it creates a hosthe and\nantagonistic disposition in the advocates attacked,\nwhose eloquence, however feeble it may be, will be\nredoubled by resentment at the insults to which\nthey have been subjected. Above all, it involves a\ncomplete waste of one of the most valuable of an\norator's assets, namely that self-restraint which gives\nweight and credit to his words, if he debases himself from an honest man into a snarling wrangler,\ndirecting all his efforts not to win the goodwill of the\njudge, but to gratify his client's spite. Often too\nthe attractions of freedom of speech will lure him\ninto a rashness of language perilous not merely to\nthe interests of the case, but to those of the speaker himself. It was not without good reason that Pericles used to pray that no word might occur to his\nmind that could give offence to the people. But\nwhat he felt with regard to the people, I feel with\nregard to every audience, since they can cause just\nas much harm to the orator as the people could\never do to Pericles. For utterances which seemed\ncourageous at the moment of speaking, are called\nfoolish when it is found that they have given offence. In view of the tact that there is commonly a great\nvariety in the aims which pleaders set before themselves and that the diligence shown by some is\nbranded as tedious caution, while the readiness of\nothers is criticised as rashness, I think that this will\nbe an appropriate place to set forth my views as to\nhow the orator may strike the happy mean. He will\nshow all the diligence of which he is capable in his\npleading. For to plead worse than he might have\ndone, is not merely an indication of negligence, but\nstamps him as a had man and a traitor, disloyal to the\ncause which he has undertaken. Consequently he\nmust refuse to undertake more cases than he feels\nhe can manage. As far as possible he will deliver\nonly what he has written, and, if circumstances\npermit, only what he has, as Demosthenes says,\ncarved into shape. Such a practice is possible in\nfirst hearings and also in subsequent hearings such as\nare granted in the public courts after an interval of\nseveral days. On the other hand, when we have to\nreply on the spot, it is impossible to prepare everything in fact for the less ready type of speaker, it\nmay, in the event of his opponents putting forward\narguments quite other than those which they were\nexpected to advance, be a positive drawback to have written anything. For it is only with reluctance\nthat such speakers will under such circumstances\nconsent to abandon what they have written, and\nthroughout their pleading keep looking back and\ntrying to discover whether any portion of their\nmanuscript can be saved from the wreck and interpolated into what they have to improvise. And if\nthey do make such interpolations, the result is a lack\nof' cohesion which is betrayed not merely by the\ngaping of the seams where the patch has been unskilfully inserted, but by the differences of style.\nConsequently, the vigour of their eloquence will be\nhampered and their thought will lack connexion, each\nof which circumstances reacts unfavourably upon the\nother, since what is written trammels the mind\ninstead of following its lead. Therefore, in such\npleadings we must, as the rustic adage says, For since the case turns on the\npropounding and refutation of arguments, it is\nalways possible to write out what we propose to\nadvance on our own behalf, and similar preparation\nis also possible with regard to the refutation of such\nreplies as are absolutely certain to be made by our\nadversary for there are times when we have this\ncertainty. But with regard to all other portions of\nour speech, the only preparation that is possible in\nadvance consists in a thorough knowledge of our\ncase, while there is a second precaution which may\nbe taken in court, consisting in giving our best\nattention to our opponent's speech. On the other\nhand, there is much that may be thought out in\nadvance and we may forearm our mind against all\npossible emergencies, a course which is far safer\nthan writing, since a train of thought can easily be abandoned or diverted in a new direction. But\nwhether we have to improvise a reply, or are obliged\nto speak extempore by some other reason, the orator\non whom training, study and practice have conferred\nthe gift of facility, will never regard himself as lost\nor taken at hopeless disadvantage. He stands\narmed for battle, ever ready for the fray, and his\neloquence will no more fail him in the courts than\nspeech will fail him in domestic affairs and the daily\nconcerns of life and he will never shirk his burden\nfor fear of failing to find words, provided he has time\nto study his case for all other knowledge will always\nbe his at command.
